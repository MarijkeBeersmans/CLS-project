Invaders From Mars
The mood of Invaders From Mars is suspenseful.
The plot centers around evil aliens, young heroes, and a heroic mission.
It is an independent, thriller, and sci-fi movie.
In approach, Invaders From Mars is fantastical and serious.
It takes place, at least partly, on a spacecraft and at a school.
It is a remake.
