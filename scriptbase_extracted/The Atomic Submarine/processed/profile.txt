The Atomic Submarine
The mood of The Atomic Submarine is suspenseful and stylized.
The plot centers around benign aliens, space travel, and androids and robots.
It is a thriller, sci-fi, and action movie.
In approach, The Atomic Submarine is fantastical and serious.
It takes place, at least partly, in a submarine and in an ocean or sea.
It is especially suggested for a boys' night.
