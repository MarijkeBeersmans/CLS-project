                                   NARRATOR
                         In the third millennium, the
                         world... changed.

          MONTAGE (STOCK - IF DESIRED)
          
          Vicious events, both natural and man-made. Earthquakes.
          Floods. Ice storms. War. Riots. Chaos and injustice.

                                   NARRATOR(CONT'D)
                         Climate. Nations. Borders. All
                         were in upheaval. Humanity itself
                         turned as violent as the planet.
                         Civilization threatened to collapse.
                         And then... a solution was found.
                         The crumbling, teetering legal
                         system was merged with the
                         overburdened police, creating a
                         powerful and efficient hybrid.
                         Trained equally in jurisprudence
                         and combat, these new guardians 
                         of Society could dispense both
                         justice and punishment. They were 
                         police, jury and executioner, all
                         in one. They were... The Judges.

          It looks like the beginning of time... or its end. Nothing
          grows here. Nothing could. This is the CURSED EARTH. With a
          WHIRR, a SHUTTLE appears in the sky. We PAN it to a GIANT CITY
          WALL. A LOCK-LIKE GATE chugs open. The shuttle ENTERS.

          As the massive craft settles, it is sprayed down by HI-POWERED

          One by one the parolees return to society. We follow the last:
          HERMAN FERGUSON ("FERGIE"). Fergie's a genius - a genius
          without common sense, street smarts, or muscle tone. So his
          career as a master criminal has gone absolutely nowhere.

          Fergie hurries through the gate. We follow him - as he stops in
          his tracks. He's looking at
          A MAGNIFICENT CITY.
          Giant towers reach miles into the sky. Elevated skyways are
          filled with traffic. Flying Barges and Shuttles service the
          highest levels. Dominating all is a building shaped like an
          EAGLE: The Hall of Justice. Almost lost and forgotten among' 
          the towering buildings is a relic from our time: The Statue of 
          Liberty. Title Supered:

          Fergie takes another look at the gleaming city, and then his

                         Fuck. That's Judge Dredd. We gotta
                         surrender while we can--
                         
          He starts to raise his gun over his head. Zed smacks him in the
          yaw with his own weapon.

                                   ZED
                         You chickenshit bowab! He's gonna
                         surrender to us. And then we'll
                         blow his brains out.
                         (shouting).
                         Come and get us, Dredd!
                         
          Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the
          others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too.

                                   REGGIE
                         More ammo!
                         
          A terrified Fergie hands him a clip.


          :SC: EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

          The stream of GUNFIRE chews up the pavement at Dredd's feet.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Down! You crazy futz - !

          DREDD
          strides calmly over to them.

                                   DREDD
                         He's firing a 64 laze pumper from
                         six hundred feet. He couldn't hit
                         me if I painted a bull's eye on my
                         ass.
                         (GLANCING UP)
                         We'll keep it simple. Standard
                         relay. Single file. I'm point.
                         
          Hershey nods. Brisco, eager to prove himself, steps in front
          of Dredd at the Heavenly Block entrance.

                                   DREDD(CONT'D)
                         You - last.
                         
          Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as
          he draws his massive LAWGIVER HANDGUN. Dredd speaks into the
          tiny computer in the breech as he aims at the door.

                                   DREDD(CONT'D)
                         Grenade.
                         
          Boom! The round knocks the steel door off its hinges. Dredd
          shifts it aside and the Judges enter.

          Feraie, terrified, passes loaded ammo clips to his "friends".
          The WHIRR of a motor outside the hallway attracts his attention.

          HIS POV - THE FOOD ROBOT - ON ITS ROUNDS

          FERGIE
          Looks at his crazed "friends" and then backs up to the robot...

          CUT TO:


          :SC: INT. HEAVENLY HAVEN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Dredd, Hershey, and Brisco stride forward. SOUND of GUNFIRE
          tells them they are close to their target.

                                   HERSHEY
                         (TENTATIVELY POINTING)
                         I think they're there -
                         
          Dredd shakes his head... points...down.

                                   DREDD
                         No. There.

          CUT TO:

          :SC: INT. SQUATTER'S ROOMS - NIGHT

          The squatters here are so busy FIRING their own guns out the
          window they don't SEE the CIRCLE OF BULLET HOLES that carve an
          opening above their heads!
          With a CRASH, the section of ceiling FALLS IN - Dredd rides it
          down, FIRING!
          NEW ANGLE.
          His shots catch most of the shooters by surprise. The few
          survivors throw down their weapons.

                                   DREDD
                         This room is pacified.
                         
          He moves carefully through the smoke. Behind him, Hershey and
          Brisco
          jump down to the floor, check the bodies. Hershey cuffs
          those still alive.

          AT THE DOOR TO THE NEXT ROOM
          Dredd avcids the door, moves along the wall. Suddenly Brisco
          darts forward.

                                   BRISCO
                         This one's mine!

                                   HERSHEY
                         No!
                         
          Dredd moves to stop him but he's too far away. Brisco kicks
          the door open -

          IN THE NEXT SQUATTER'S ROOM
          He's face to face with Reggie, Zed, and Twist.

                                   BRISCO
                         This room is under--
                         
          BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA! Brisco is blown backwards off his feet.

          DREDD
          spins around. Sees Brisco dead in the doorway. Snarls,
          enraged. Hershey whirls, KICKS down one of the wounded who
          tries to escape in the confusion.

          IN THE OTHER ROOM

                                   TWIST

                         (SUDDENLY NOTICING)
                         Hey. Where's the little ammo dude?
                         
          As they all look for Fergie, the wall next to the door EXPLODES
          OPEN. Dredd enters through it.

                                   DREDD
                         You're all under arrest. Will you
                         surrender, or would you like your
                         trials now?
                         
          They look at him for a moment - then BLAST away.

                                  
          Dredd hides for cover, FIRES back - but one guy has a weapon as big as
          a chainsaw, and it's decimating Dredd's hiding place.

                                   DREDD
                         (INTO LAWGIVER)

          BEEP and LED change on the weapon. Dredd FIRES - 
          at HIS ENEMY.
          The bullet goes THROUGH his weapon, kills him! 

          BACK TO SCENE.
          Dredd turns, sees Reggie and another squatter charging at him
          from both sides.

                                   DREDD
                         (INTO LAWGIVER)
                         DOUBLE WHAMMYI


          BEEP. He FIRES. Two bullets come out at once, each taking
          out a man! But Reggae's body rolls into Dredd, knocking him
          off his feet!
          CLOSE ON DREDD.
          He's lost his Lawgiver! He reaches out for it - and gets kicked
          in the head! CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Twist, suddenly courageous
          with Dredd on the floor.

                                   TWIST
                         (SEEING IT)
                         Lawgiver! Awesome!
                         
          And he snatches it up, and aims at Dredd's head!

          WIDER

                                   ZED
                         (SHOUTING)
                         Don't touch it! They're booby
                         trapped!
                         
          Too late. A high pitched BEEP is the only warning before the
          Handgun EXPLODES, knocking Zed off his feet.

          NEW ANGLE
           
          Zed starts to get up - sees Twist's ARM on his body! Screaming,
          flings it aside and jumps up - right into Dredd's KICK.

                                   DREDD
                         Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8.

          WHAM! He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He
          fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away.

          Zed blocks Dredd's next blow; pulls him into a brutal embrace,
          slams Dredd against the wall. Again!

          Dredd breaks free! Slams Zed once, twice. Zed flies back
          against the wall.

          CAMERA REVEALS that Zed another weapon hidden behind his back.
          Now, he goes for it!

                                   FAVORING DREDD
          We weren't expecting Zed's move. Dredd was. While we were
          blinking, he kicked a fallen weapon up from the floor and caught

                                   DREDD
                         No... Death.
                         
          He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's
          ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart.

          Other Judges and paramedics have arrived. The Judges process
          arrestees and the paramedics see to the wounded.
          Herschey rooks on beside Dredd as Brisco's body is zipped into
          a cac and carried away.

                                   HERSHEY
                         I was supposed to watch out for him.

                         He made the mistake. Not you.
                         
          Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and
          confusion he has heard something. He turns.

          NEW ANGLE
          The food robot is coming down the corridor, skittering around
          bodies and debris.
          Its actions are less smooth than before, and its voice seems
          off, too.

                                   FOOD ROBOT
                         Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and
                         nutritious food rations, ready to
                         eat!
                         
          Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows.
          She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path,
          takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it!

                                   DREDD

                         (TO ROBOT)

                         The guide wire in the floor isn't
                         working.

                         selection and - credit in the slot
                         and-and - shit!
                         
          The robot stops. The jumble of food in back spills out and
          Fergie uncoils from the cramped interior, still holding the
          scarK r.a wires he was using to manipulate the machine.

                         legal. I sentence you to five years

          The gleaming civil and legal heart of Mega-City, shaped like 
          the symbol of the Judge System itself: An Eagle. 

                                   VOICE (GRIFFIN) 
                         My fellow Judges, have we forgotten 
                         the lessons of History? 

          :SC: INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          The CAMERA discovers the Mega-City Council of Judges, in mid- 
          session CHIEF JUST ICE FARGO, 70, sits at an elevated position 
          at a great BLACK TABLE. Other Judges sit on either side of him. 
          Among them are JUDGE MCGRUDER, a woman in her 60's, open minded 
          but with an iron will; JUDGE ESPOSITO, 50's, thoughtful, 
          accommodating; JUDGE YAMAMOTO, 50's, short-tempered, yet fair; 
          and JUDGE GRIFFIN , 60, with a mind and body as honed as men half 
          his age, his clean features can hide much. But now, they hide 
          nothing: His passion and sincerity make his words ring.
           
                                   GRIFFIN (cont'd) 
                         A Republic is a body politic that 
                         is susceptible to many ills... from 
                         eninu to anarchy. And the block 
                         war today was a definite warning 
                         sign of -
           
          COUNCIL REACTS as rowdily as the British Parliament. 

                                   MCGRUDER 
                         - of your misguided policies as 
                         Urban Administrator!

                         Hold on, Judge McGruder - let's not
                         blame the messenger! Judge Griffin
                         HAS -

                         - Griffin has been trying to get
                         us to swallow his crime package 
                         for two years now and I still have
                         INDIGESTION -
                         
          UPROAR. We sense that the room is evenly divided. A GAVEL
          BANGS for order with a CRACK like thunder. Everyone quiets as
          quickly as schoolchildren..

          FAVORING FARGO

                                   FARGO
                         Order, order! As presiding Justice,
                         I only vote to break a tie. But
                         I wish to address the question of
                         Judge Griffin's crime package. Is
                         there any objection?

                                   GRIFFIN
                         This entire body owes its very
                         existence to you, Chief Justice.
                         (looking around)
                         I can't imagine anyone having an
                         objection.
                         
          CAMERA sweeps towards Fargo, passing over the MAP of North 
          America etched on the great DAIS. Only a few lights stand out 
          on all the continent: MEGA-CITY ONE; MEGA-CITY TWO; TEXAS CITY; 
          and the ASPEN PENAL COLONY. All the rest is labeled THE CURSED 
          EARTH. 
          Fargo stands, eyes blazing with intelligence and intensity. 
          we sense t h at we are observing a Lion in Winter. And the lion
          can still roar.

                                   FARGO
                         This body is not the first assembly
                         to think that more laws and fewer
                         choices will bring peace and order. 
                         That delusion has been tried and
                         failed before. If the citizens of
                         Mega-City are demanding more control
                         of their lives, that's not a threat
                         - it's a signal! A signal to open
                         the windows of our society and let
                         it breathe -
                         (a look to Griffin)
                         Not to bolt the door and throw away
                         the key! My fellow Judges, I was 
                         barely in my teens when I put on
                         this badge. When the time comes
                         for me to take it off... let me do
                         it. knowing that it stood for
                         Freedom... and not for Repression.
                         
          He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.

                                   JUDGE GRIFFIN
                         Once again, Chief Justice, you have
                         served as a moral compass for all
                         of us. I... withdraw my proposal.
                         (PAUSE)
                         I hope ... for-good.

                         four of them allegedly 
                         killed by a gang of squatters...
                         who were themselves killed in 
                         summary executions by Judge Dredd.

                                   
          CAMERA WIDENS as the Council Chamber doors OPEN. The Judges
          come out. Griffin comes over, watches with Dredd. Dredd
          stiffens at the approach of his superior. Griffin silently
          indicates for him to stand at ease.

                         Some people say that to be a Judge
                         on these mean streets is bound to 
                         have a certain dehumanizing effect, 
                         and that we should sympathize with 
                         the Judges. I agree. But the Mega- 
                         City Council apparently doesn't. 
                         To them, "dehumanization" isn't just 
                         a buzz word 
                         - it's a byword. And
                         I'll show just how terrifyingly far

                         Although I doubt Judge Griffin would 
                         recognize a new reality if he 
                         arrested it himself.

          Dredd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him

                         isn't a Judge in Mega-City who
                         doesn't want to follow in your

                         A short one, I'm afraid. Duty
                         calls.

                                   RICO
                         (LAUGHS )
                         We're both prisoners here. You
                         behind a desk... me behind...this.
                         Fargo's reward for our services.

                                   MILLER
                         When you killed innocent people you
                         went far beyond service.
                         
          Rico stands. Moves toward the energy curtain. Glares at
          Miller.

                                   RICO
                         "Innocent"? A meaningless word.
                         The innocent exist only until they
                         inevitably become perpetrators
                         themselves. In the end, "Guilt"
                         and "Innocence" are merely a matter
                         of timing.

                                   MILLER
                         You're insane.

                                   RICO
                         Am I? When did you become a
                         perpetrator? Was it the time you
                         found money mysteriously transferred
                         into your account? Or the time I
                         was sentenced to death? You've been
                         taking bribes for years, Warden.
                         You're a criminal. And a stupid
                         one: You don't even know who's
                         paying you.

                                   MILLER
                         I don't want to know.

                                   RICO
                         If ignorance is bliss, Warden, then 
                         you must be very blissful.
                         (WEARY)
                         Miller, why are you here?

                                   MILLER
                         Your mysterious benefactor has sent
                         you a package.
                         
          Miller speaks into a console before Rico's laser-guarded "cell".

                                   MILLER (CONT'D)
                         Deactivate Shield.
                         
          ENERGY CURTAIN drops. The autoguns on the wall swivel
          toward Rico. Miller moves onto the platform, hands over the
          package. Rico places his thumb on the lock and it OPENS
          THE PACKAGE.
          Rico's JUDGE'S BADGE rests inside. Along with a PHOTOGRAPH...
          of Hammond, the newscaster. And... what appears to be a
          "Rubic's Cube" type TUBULAR PUZZLE.
          Rico begins to manipulate the puzzle.

                                   MILLER
                         (CURIOUS)
                         What is that?

                                   RICO
                         The Ancient Puzzle, Miller: The
                         One about the Meaning of Life.

                                   MILLER
                         (SARCASTIC)
                         Really. And what is the meaning
                         of Life?

                                   RICO
                         It's over.
                         
          And he AIMS the "puzzle". BLAM!
          
          MILLER
          The SHOT from the tiny weapon hits him in the throat. Gasping,
          ne falls onto his knees. With one hand on his throat, he
          staggers to the door while Rico descends from his platform.

                                   MILLER
                         (COUGHING)

                         Voice not recognized. Security
                         Breach. Autoguns targeting.
                         
          Miller panics. Scrambles for the door.

                                   MILLER
                         NO!
                         
          BOOM' BOOM! BOOM! He's cut down ten feet from the door.

          OUTSIDE THE DOOR - THE TWO GUARDS
          Jack shells into their riot guns. Charge inside -

          BACK IN THE CELL
          The guards only see Miller's body. Then Rico swings down from
          his hiding place - the turret of an autogun! He KICKS out with
          both feet - drives both Guards into the Energy Curtain. ZAP!
          They're instantly FRIED.

          WIDER
          
          Rico dismounts like an acrobat, holds his badge up towards the
          autogun scanner. BEEP. The autoguns pivots away. The DOOR
          OPENS. Rico snatches up a weapon - steps outside.

          WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his
          every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one "Q" ran in
          the Bond movies.
          Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage
          of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet
          off. The class OOOHS and AHHS.

                                   DREDD (CONT'D)

          NEW ANGLE
          Dredd moves to another training station. Another tech nods:
          Ready.

          She is exchanging her battered helmet. Now, she notices Dredd,
          lingers to watch, impressed with his style.

          Now he moves to several Techs who are hurriedly tweaking the

                         off and landing, flight capacity
                         and 500 kilometer range.
                         
          The head Tech gives thumbs up while the other techs step back.
          The class waits, expectant. The lead tech throws a REMOTE.
          SPARKS fly. The motor COUGHS, dies. The class GROANS. Dredd
          glares at the embarrassed technicians.

                                   DREDD (CONT'D)
                         Yours... if they ever get it to

          LAUGHTER. Dredd moves to a lectern. Faces the class.

                                   DREDD (CONT'D)
                         All of these things are nothing 
                         but toys. Bottom line, final word, 
                         end of the day, when you're alone
                         in the dark... all that counts...
                         is this.
                         
          takes something from the lectern shelf, throws it down. It's
          all-but holy book: THE LAW.

                         And you will be alone. Because when
                         you swear to uphold these ideals, 
                         you are sacrificing whatever chance 
                         you have for a Life. 
                         
          They Frown;
          this is not what they expected to hear from a
          legend. They become increasingly unnerved.

          The talk upsets her, too, perhaps more than the others.

                         For most of us there is only lonely
                         death on the streets... or, for
                         those few of us who survive to old 
                         age... the prouder loneliness of

          :SC: INT. ACADEMY LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Hershey is drying her hair with a towel. OLMEYER, a short, 
          earnest underclassman, approaches her. He's carrying a large 
          BOOK. 

                                   OLMEYER 
                         Judge Hershey, the yearbook deadline 
                         is only a week away. Have you 
                         changed your mind? 

                                   HERSHEY 
                         Forget it, Olmeyer. I'm not gonna 
                         be the yearbook Centerfold! 

                                   OLMEYER 
                         It's not a centerfold, it's a 
                         calendar! And it won't be a tacky 
                         3-D hologram. The yearbook is all 
                         classic print and 2-D. Here, let

          He starts to open the book. She slams it closed on his fingers. 

                                   HERSHEY 
                         No, let me show you a dummy. 
                         
          She turns his head so he can SEE his reflection. When he turns 
          back - she's gone. 

          WITH HERSHEY
          
          She sees Dredd at an end locker. Decides. Approaches him.

                         Judge Dredd? 
                         He looks at her, waiting. 
                         I caught your lecture today. Do...

                         Well, I think your truth is
                         relative. I have a personal life.

                         What happened?

          Dredd takes off his helmet. It's the first time we've seen his
          face, and it's filled with barely controlled emotion.

                                   DREDD

          He struggles and we see his captor, hanging upside down in the 
          landing gear: Rico. He drops to the ground like an acrobat, 
          Holding his victim all the way down. The man's neck SNAPS on 
          impact. Rico drags the body into the shadows. 

          :SC: EXT. MEGA CITY - NIGHT
           
          Not a nice part of town. The FACES we SEE and the SOUNDS we 
          HEAR are unnerving. This is not the shiny part of the future. 
          We HOLD on the scene, finally WIDEN to find Rico. Wearing the 
          clothes of the ground crewman he killed, he walks past rows of 
          people enraptured in violent/erotic VIDEO GAMES. He's searching 
          something; And then he sees it: 

          A busy ever-changing SIGN: GEIGER'S BAZAAR.
          PAWN - FAX BOXES - VOUCHERS CASHED. He heads inside.
           
          :SC: INT. GEIGER'S - NIGHT
          Pawnshop. Surplus and funk hangs from the
          severed walls. The rear is divided by a ceiling-high locked
          fence that secures the better grade merchandise. GEIGER, 50's,
          as Rico enters. Puffs on a cigar.

                                   GEIGER
                         We've closed for the night.

                                   RICO
                         You're holding a package for me.
                         I'm. Rick.

                                   GEIGER
                         Oh, yeah... Gimme a second.

          While Geiger gets it, Rico quickly scans the store. A simple
          security camera in the corner. A jumble of crates and large
          antique weapons... including a few things that look like rusting
          metal warriors. Rico points to these.

                                   RICO
                         I thought they destroyed all the
                         ABC Warbots?

                                   GEIGER
                         (COMING BACK)
                         You can collect 'em if you make 'em
                         non-functional. Like my wife.
                         (hands him box)
                         Here you go.
                         
          Geiger pretends not to watch as Rico unlocks the box. Geiger 
          sneaks a look... sees a uniform... and a Judge's Lawgiver. Rico
          starts to reach inside. Geiger stops him.

                                   GEIGER
                         Whoa, friend, whoever sent you this
                         is no friend at all.

                                   RICO
                         Oh? And why's that?

                                   GEIGER
                         That's a Lawgiver. It's programmed
                         to only recognize a Judge's hand.
                         You want a weapon, I can get you
                         something nice. But if you touch
                         that it'll take your arm off.

                                   RICO
                         Really?
                         
          He grabs it! Geiger flinches - then looks puzzled.

                                   RICO (CONT'D)
                         How do you like that?
                         
          He SHOOTS Geiger at point-blank range. Geiger hits the floor.

                                   RICO (CONT'D)
                         I must be a Judge.
                         
          Rico bends, takes Geiger's keys and his cigars... then goes to
          the big cage.
          
          ON THE ABC ROBOT
          
          A huge, armored combat veteran. We HEAR the metal cage rattle
          open. Rico approaches, crouches down and pulls a panel off the
          robot's body.
          Inside, the circuit cards have all been pulled from their
          sockets.
          Rico begins whistling... reveille. He pushes the boards back
          in, hits the RESET button.

          WIDER
          The ROBOT starts to WHIR. A GUSH of steam rises from its
          powerful torso. The eyes glow RED. It stands to its eight foot
          height, slowly turning like an arthritic old man.

                                   ROBOT
                         Status. Commander. Mission.
                         
          Rico strikes a match on the robot, lights a cigar.

                                   RICO
                         Status: Personal bodyguard.

          Hammond and his wife LILY are in their modest apartment. The
          antiques and decorations hint at a warmer era - our own. Both
          wear nightclothes. Hammond paces, edgy with decision. Lily
          weaves on a COMPUTERIZED LOOM.

                         Vardis, if you're right, then this
                         Judge Dredd isn't really part of
                         the conspiracy.

                                   HAMMOND
                         No, of course not. It began before
                         he was born. It had to have.

                                   LILY
                         Then your report tomorrow will
                         destroy an innocent man. Doesn't
                         Dredd's future bother you?

                                   HAMMOND
                         Yes. But I'm more worried about
                         all of our futures then about
                         Judge...
                         
          The door THUDS open. Startled, they turn -

          Standing in the doorway is a JUDGE.

          stops his Lawmaster, gets off. We FOLLOW him towards a slick
          wet dream of a FUTURE GULL-WINGED CAR... parked in a
          HANDICAPPED ZONE.
          Dredd takes out a BAR CODE READER, scans the license plate. As
          the gizmo searches its data base, the FUPPIE (Future Yuppie) CAR
          owner runs into view with a Cappuccino in a styrofoam cup. He
          "oeeos" the lock, but Dredd blocks his way to the car door.

                                   DREDD
                         Is this your car?

                         Of course not. Towing is the
                         penalty for the first offense. This
                         is your second violation.

          Dredd aims, FIRES. The car EXPLODES! Dredd walks casually away
          while the car's owner stands slack-jawed with debris tinkling
          around him.

          The wreck burning behind him, Dredd head back towards his
          bike... suddenly STOPS. He sees TWO FIGURES in front of him.
          And, the moment he does, he knows without. looking that there are
          two identical ones behind him.
          They're garbed for combat, yet without even the trace of
          humanity that seeps through a Street Judge's armor. These are
          the feared JUDGE HUNTERS. All have drawn weapons. The LEADER
          holds up a HOLO WARRANT with Dredd's PICTURE.

          CAMERA ADJUSTS. We SEE Griffin is standing below him.

                         I'm afraid the evidence is
                         conclusive. The trial will be just
                         a formality.
                         
          Fargo descends shakily from his seat. Moves to the window. He
          fetches a pill from his pocket, tries to swallow it without
          seeing.

                         Is it possible? Dredd, homicidal

                         We were able to hide the facts then.

                         council ordered the termination of
                         Janus... the complete termination.
                         You obviously ignored that order...

                                   DREDD
                         Murder.
                         
          :SC: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

          EXPLOSION of GUNFIRE on the MAIN SCREEN. We WIDEN. We're
          seeing the tail end of a SURVEILLANCE VIDEO of the murders of 
          Vardis and Lily Hammond, taken by a camera outside their
          apartment.

                                   JUDGE MCGRUDER'S VOICE
                         Stop Video.

          :SC: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - WIDER - DAY

          The place is absolutely packed. Every off-duty Judge in
          Mega-City is here. So is every Cadet from the Academy, plus the
          entire media brigade. We note that two oddly reassuring
          dements from our era are still here: A COURTROOM ARTIST (with
          a computer sketchpad and lightpen), and a COURTROOM STENOGRAPHER
          with his hands stuffed into a FIST STENO KEYBOARD.) Make no
          mistake about it: this is a real, fair trial. And we're going
          to see it.

                                   MCGRUDER (CONT'D)
                         Before we go on, I wish to make a
                         personal comment.
                         (TURNING)
                         Judge Dredd. I have observed your
                         career from its outset and I have
                         the highest regard for you.
                         Nevertheless, I must prosecute you
                         to the best of my ability.

          DREDD - AT THE DEFENDANT'S STATION

                                   DREDD
                         That is the Law, Judge McGruder.
                         I would expect no less.

          NEW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HIGHEST SEAT
          In Judge Fargo's place sits Judge Griffin. He is wearing the
          uniform of the Chief Justice.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         The Court shares in Judge McGruder's
                         sentiments. In a way I am glad that
                         Judge Fargo is about to begin his
                         Long Walk.
                         He will be spared the pain of this
                         trial. Proceed, Judge McGruder.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         The video you have just seen is

                         is inadmissible as evidence.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         Judge Hershey, are you serious?
                         Both of them recognized Judge Dredd!

                                   HERSHEY
                         That is the State's interpretation.

          It rewinds. Then:

                         Doesn't Dredd's future-bother

                                   HAMMOND'S VOICE 
                         Yes. But I'm more worried about 
                         all of our futures then about 
                         Judge ...Dredd...? 

                                   HERSHEY
                         Stop video. Do you hear it? When
                         Lily Hammond says "Dredd", it's 
                         part of the conversation. And when
                         Vardis Hammond says 'Dredd' it 
                         could just as easily be the same.
                         The suggestion that either has
                         recognized their murderer is sheer
                         supposition... or, in the case of
                         the prosecution, wishful-thinking!
                         
          BIG REACTION from the packed room. Griffin bangs the gavel for
          silence.

          THE DEFENSE TABLE
          Hershey returns here to get another document. Dredd WHISPERS.

                                   DREDD
                         Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I
                         picked you to defend me.

                                   HERSHEY
                         You only picked me because you
                         didn't have anyone else.

                                   DREDD
                         I'm still glad.
                         
          CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         (TO HERSHEY)
                         All right, counselor. Forget the
                         the audio. What about the video? 
                         It clearly shows -

                                   HERSHEY
                         It clearly shows nothing!
                         (TURNING)
                         Your Honor, I have here an affidavit
                         from Cadet Olmeyer, currently a
                         Junior at the Academy.
                         
          OLMEYER IN THE AUDIENCE
          The heads of the other cadets around him swivel to look at him
          in new regard. He does his best to look cool.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by 
                         all his instructors to be an expert
                         in the field of still and video
                         graphics. His affidavit states that
                         this surveillance video is of such
                         low definition that even after all
                         known enhancements are used, no
                         positive identification can be made
                         of the killer. Since the uniform
                         of a Judge could be counterfeit,
                         I repeat my objection to this video
                         being entered as evidence in this
                         case.
                         (turning to Griffin)
                         I ask for a ruling.


          You could hear a pin drop in the vast room. Everyone watching
          is sure they know what Griffin will say. They're all wrong.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Objection... sustained. The video
                         is inadmissible.

          ON OLMEYER - IN AUDIENCE

                                   OLMEYER
                         Yessss!
                         
          The rest of the courtroom goes nuts. Griffin bangs for order.
          The BAILIFFS call out.

                                   BAILIFFS
                         Order, order!

          HERSHEY
          returns to the defendant's table as the court quiets down.
          Olmeyer WHOOPS a second longer than everyone else. 
          Embarrassed, he quiets down, but not before Dredd notices him.

                                   DREDD
                         That kid barely knows me and he
                         wants to save my ass.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Trust me. It's not your ass he's
                         interested in.

          JUDGE MCGRUDER

                                   MCGRUDER
                         Your Honor. I am forced now to
                         enter certain technical evidence
                         of a critical nature regarding 
                         the Mega-City Legal system. I 
                         will need the Court's permission. 
                         I will also need permission to 
                         access the Central Computer Bank. 

          HERSHEY AND DREDD
          They look at each other, as puzzled as everyone else. 

                                   MCGRUDER (cont'd) 
                         I can think of no evidence or issue 
                         more critical than the murder trial of 
                         a Judge. You may proceed. 

          BACK TO SCENE
          McGruder approaches a special CONSOLE. This is one of many in 
          Mega-City that permit access to "Central" - the Judge System's
          main computer. Most of the consoles look alike, but this has
          the largest screen we will see.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         Central. I wish to access weapons
                         schematics, Judges division. Describe
                         the workings of the standard Judge's
                         sidearm, the Lawgiver Two, and
                         especially its improvements over
                         the earlier Lawgiver One.
                         
          Central SPEAKS. Somehow its monotonous, sexless voice hints
          at an actual personality.

                                   CENTRAL
                         One moment.

          NEW ANGLE
          COMPUTER GRAPHICS illustrating these words APPEARS on screen.

                                   CENTRAL (CONT'D)
                         Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
                         Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
                         The difference lies in two areas:
                         The computer chip and the ammunition
                         coding. Like the Model one, the
                         computer chip recognizes the
                         thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
                         may use each other's firearms; but
                         a suspect dare not use a Judge's
                         weapon against a Judge.
                         
          ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

                                   CENTRAL (CONT'D)
                         However, the ammunition coding in
                         the Model Two is not cued to the 
                         thumbcode recognition chip.
                         Instead, it is coded to the personal
                         DNA of the Judge using the weapon.

          DREDD & HERSHEY
          Listening carefully, wondering where this is going.

                                   CENTRALS VOICE
                         This is obtained in a download from
                         my medical files and upgraded
                         automatically every time the weapon
                         is reloaded. Each time a round is
                         chambered and fired, it is tagged
                         with the relevant DNA.

          NEW ANGLE

          we slowly TIGHTEN on McGruder and her "witness".

                                   MCGRUDER
                         Central. Were the bullets recovered
                         from the bodies of Vardis and Lily 
                         Hammond so DNA coded?

                                   CENTRAL
                         Yes, Judge McGruder. It could not
                         be otherwise.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         And what was the result of the
                         computer check of the DNA coding
                         on those bullets?
          
          We could swear that the computer is going for drama.

                                   CENTRAL
                         The DNA is a perfect match for Judge
                         Joseph Dredd.

                         necessary. The evidence is
                         irrefutable.
                         (LOOKS AROUND)
                         We have reached a verdict. In the 
                         charge of Pre-meditated Murder, we
                         the Jury find Joseph Dredd GUILTY
                         as charged.

          Before Hershey can tell him to, Dredd obeys. Griffin looks him
          in the eye. Dredd looks back, unblinking.

                         Joseph Dredd, for this crime the 
                         Law allows only one punishment:
                         DEATH.
                         
          ECHO rebounds from every wall. As the gasps fade away, Griffin
          taxes out a sealed document.

                         However: I have here the last order
                         of Judge Fargo, written this morning
                         before he prepared for the Long
                         Walk.
                         (OPENING IT)
                         He orders that this Court be lenient
                         with Judge Dredd, in gratitude for
                         his years of service.
                         (setting this down)
                         It has always been our-custom to
                         carry out the last order of a
                         Walking Judge. We will so honor
                         this one.
                         (NEW TONE)
                         The sentence is Life Imprisonment
                         - to be carried out immediately.
                         As it is Written:
                         
          Griffin picks up the book of the Law, kisses it. Opens it.
          And reads.

          DREDD - SOMEWHERE - 
          wrists manacled, head down. The Judge Hunters pull off his 
          armor, then literally rip away his uniform. He's naked,
          helpless. Chained.

          :SC: EXT. GATES OF MEGA CITY - SUNSET

          It is the ceremony of The Long Walk. Judge Fargo stands alone,
          wearing a LONG DUSTER COAT and a wide brimmed HAT. Before him
          he holds his uniform, Lawgiver, and badge in a ceremonial
          bundle.
          A young FEMALE CADET in an sweet Contralo that contrasts with
          Griffin's bass READS from a different part of The Law:

                         Law he served so well to those who
                         have it not."
                         
          The great city gate begins to OPEN. Under a fading SUNSET we
          SEE the forbidden land beyond: THE CURSED EARTH. We TIGHTEN on
          Fargo, grizzled, weary; the girl, fresh, tearful. Like so many,
          she reveres this man and what he represents.

                                   FEMALE CADET
                         "Let him be written in our hearts

          She hands him the Book. Receives his bundle of worldly
          belongings in return. A young MALE CADET steps forward, hands
          Fargo an ancient REMINGTON.

          Dredd is shoved into a jammed PRISON SHUTTLE. GUARDS fling him in 
          seat. The shuttle door closes, locks.

          :SC: INT. GRIFFIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Griffin comes inside. His chair turns around. Rico is sitting 
          in it. Griffin looks at him in shock for a moment. 

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Are you out of your mind, coming
                         here?
                         
          Griffin angrily starts forward... stops when the ABC robot moves
          to block his path.

                                   GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
                         And you brought this, too?
                         
          Griffin waves his hand over desk controls. The lights DIM.
          SHUTTERS block the windows.

                                   RICO
                         I like to do things my way. 

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Yes, I know. Like framing Dredd
                         for Hammond's murder.

                         I thought that was a nice creative
                         touch. Sort of two birds with one
                         stone.

                         Hammond had to be silenced when
                         he found out abut Janus! But I
                         could have used Dredd! He
                         practically worshiped the ground
                         I walked on-

                                   RICO
                         Dredd only worships the Law. And
                         he'd blow you away the minute he
                         found out just how much you're
                         pissing on it. Trust me: It's
                         better this way. Let him see what
                         it's like to freeze his ass off in
                         Aspen. Let him see what it's like
                         I to be me! After all...
                         
          He moves closer to Griffin, smiles.

          Griffin looks at him, decides to drop the subject.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         There's a lot of work to be done.

                         meantime... I want chaos, Rico.
                         That block war was just the
                         beginning. Now I want fear racing
                         through every street... terror in
                         every quad... panic in every block.
                         Until those miserable rezzies think
                         even their Judges can't save them.
                         That's when the Council will turn
                         to me... and to Janus.
                         
          Rico moves towards the door. Pauses.

                                   RICO
                         Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can
                         handle that. After all...
                         (slight.smile)
                         Look how quickly I brought fear in
                         here.
                         
          His smile fades and he exits.



          :SC: EXT. CURSED EARTH - NIGHT

          A HOWLING WIND blows dust across the dead landscape. The ASPEN
          PRISON SHUTTLE appears over the horizon.
          
          :SC: INT. ASPEN SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS 133

          A wide body with the amenities of a galley. Armed JUDGES 
          patrol outside a long CAGE enclosing the rows of prisoners. 
          GUARDS inside the cage are armed with STUN CLUBS. 
          CAMERA roams the ranks of hardened, brutal prisoners. Gradually 
          we realize that something is being whispered up and down the 
          rows... a slow humm that rises in level buzz and then a 
          whisper. Gradually we discern it: "dddrd...dddrdd... Dredd." 
          We reach Dredd the same time the whispers reach him. Manacled 
          like the others, he shows no reaction to the hateful glances 
          aimed in his direction. 

                                   PILOT'S VOICE

          The craft BANKS, the prisoners chains clanking as they sway. A 
          mean looking PRISONER behind Dredd leans over, hisses: 

                                   PRISONER BEHIND HIM 
                         I want a piece of you, scumbag.

                         Okay. 
                         
          Withh a SNAP and without looking, Dredd jerks his elbow 
          backwards. The prisoner is knocked unconscious. As he sags in 
          his chains, CAMERA ADJUSTS. The prisoner on the side of Dredd 
          we haven't seen is Fergie. Now, he stares at Dredd. Then 
          pins his hands over Dredd's face, leaving Dred's jaw
          unvocered and parting his fingers at Dredd's eyes, like the visor
          in the Judge's helmet. Fergie's eyes go wide.

                                   FERGIE

                         No. You got the sentence the Law
                         required. The Proper sentence.

                         then? A bug? A glitch? Typo? 
                         Fumble? Screw-up? Or maybe...

          A NEW ANGLE
          The speaker is a menacing MAN of fifty or so, with gaunt hard
          muscles, the eyes of a mad prophet, and eerie religious TATTOOS.
          Three YOUNGER MEN flanking him have similar decorations. This 
          is REVEREND ANGEL and his SONS. 
           
                                   REVEREND ANGEL (cont'd) 
                         Dredd's a machine. See, any man 
                         - even a Lawman - has a heart. But 
                         not Dredd. He's frozen inside. 
                         That's how he could make this man 
                         (he indicates himself) 
                         and these boys - watch while like 
                         the Grim Reaper himself, he coldly 
                         cut down the youngest fruit of our 
                         tree.

                         Angel: Maybe if your youngest fruit 
                         hadn't taken those hostages he could 
                         be here for the family reunion. 
                         
          As one, all the Angels lunge forward as much as their short 
          chains will allow. Fergie recoils; Dredd doesn't. But two 
          GUARDS turn at the commotion.

          A narrow window lets in the thinnest sliver of moonlight. Two
          armchairs, worn leather, from our era. A couple of exotic
          plants, now wilted. An antique bookcase of burnished wood - a
          rare material in Mega-City.
          Something rattles at the door. The lock GLOWS briefly...
          Something SNAPS. The door opens.

          Hershey steps in, putting a small tool away in a belt pouch.
          She closes the door. Takes in the monastic feel of the place.
          She moves to the bookcase: A small collection of leather-bound
          books, maybe a dozen in all. Plato, More, Jefferson, Paine.
          Hershey runs her fingers over the well-worn titles.

          Hershey opens a drawer. A few clothes. She slips her hands
          underneath, feels around, finds nothing. Opens the next drawer.
          Searches. Finds a framed "viewie" on the nightstand. It shows
          a COUPLE in their 30's with a BABY.

          She's about to put it down - when something about its weight
          makes her suspicious. She turns it over, examines it - finds a
          HIDDEN SEAL. The frame OPENS. Inside is a second viewie. It
          shows Dredd, mid-twenties - and Rico, the same age. Bot are
          grinning: Graduation day at the Academy.

          And that's when it happens. In that split-second of distraction 
          when the guards look up to listen, Pa Angel begins to reach for 
          a guard's Stun Club!

          Misunderstanding his intentions, the nearest guard ZAPS him with 
          his Stun Club! At the same moment, Pa Angel gets the other 
          guard's weapon, turns it on him! The guard DROPS. One of the 
          Angel boys grabs the key card!

          GUARD WITH DREDD
          turns, charges forward - but two Angels have already whisked the

          manacled prisoners one by one! And all the while a BUZZ like 
          the one we heard before grows and grows:

          As the aircraft banks steeply, he slides alon the floor with

          Dredd by the throat and wrist - the gun falls outside the cage 
          - Dredd SMASHES the door on Pa Angel's head, locks it!

          Somehow even these twisted and dangerous people know not to fuck
          with Rico. They move out of his way almost instinctively.

          A SCUZZY BIKER TYPE
          suddenly flies out of a doorway, SMACKS into a pole near Rico.
          He shakes off the blow, wipes blood from his mouth... howls
          with animal fury. Charges back towards the doorway.

          NEW ANGLE
          His adversary appears, a whirling, lean muscular figure in
          leather - a woman named ILSA. Now, with four spectacular karate
          moves, she hits him high, low, middle - and -the coup de grace -
          right in the balls!

          CLOSER ON THE BIKER

          the man watching her from four feet away: Rico.

                                   HERSHEY
                         (EXASPERATED)
                         The other man!
          
          She slides the viewie into the scanning aperture.

                                   CENTRAL 
                         (all business now) 
                         Scanning for identity, unknown male,
                         approximately 200 cm. tall, weighing

                         Nine. Eight. Seven. Six -
                         
          Suddenly the CONSOLE GOES DEAD with a BEEP.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Central? Central? Hello?

                                   A CANNED VOICE
                         (NOT CENTRAL)

          The viewie pops out of the slot with a thunk. Hershey looks at
          the computer suspiciously.


          :SC: INT. JANUS LAB - DAY

          After all the talk about this place, we probably expected more.
          Sure, it's big, but half the hi-tech gear is under dusty
          plastic, and the rest is under repair. Rico sweats over a
          power module, straining with a wrench.

                                   RICO
                         Come on, you piece of junk...
                         (aside to his robot)
                         No offense.
                         
          The bolt loosens. Rico can open the panel.
          
                                   RICO (cont' d)
                         Let there be Light.
                         
          He flips a switch. The OVERHEAD LIGHTS come on. (Perhaps we
          notice that the Lab seems to be retro-fitted into an older,
          metal structure with oddly irregular walls; perhap s not.)

          LAB - NEW ANGLE
          A PNEUMATIC DOOR OPENS. Griffin enters. He looks around,
          pleased.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         You've made a lot of progress.
                         Good.

                                   ILSA'S VOICE
                         Lights! About time -
                         
          His eyes narrow as Ilsa comes in from another area with a
          note board.

                                   RICO
                         (TO GRIFFIN)
                         Griffin, I think you know Professor
                         Haydyn?

                                   GRIFFIN
                         (CAREFULLY)
                         Yes. I haven't seen her since your
                         trial. When she testified that you
                         were insane... and therefore...
                         innocent.
                         
          She looks at Rico with an expression worthy of a Manson
          follower.

                                   ILSA
                         Since then I've learned innocence
                         is just another lie. And that the
                         best truths come only with pain.
                         (back to reality)
                         And... speaking of painful truths...
                         Here's our shopping list.
                         
          She hands Griffin the digital notepad.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         (READING)
                         Inducers, nitrogen coils, nano-
                         pumps... I can pull all this from
                         Mega-City hospital. They won't even
                         know it's gone. When can you be
                         on-line?

                                   RICO
                         Tomorrow. But it won't mean a thing
                         if you can't get into Central's
                         Janus files. They're still security
                         locked.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Leave that to me. Meanwhile you
                         have work to do... on the streets.

                                   RICO
                         "Fear, Terror, Panic." Yes. My
                         favorite emotions.

                                   ILSA
                         Mine too.
                         
          Rico turns, whistles at the robot like it's a dog.

                                   RICO
                         C'mon, Fido. Walkies.
                         
          The robot follows Rico and Ilsa out the door. Griffin watches
          them go, slightly unnerved.

          :SC: EXT. CURSED EARTH - DAY

          The SUN sizzles into the LENS -

          :SC: EXT. RUINED COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Fergie and Dredd are hanging by their handcuffs from a pole 
          which in turn has been set on the crossbeams of this ruined 
          building. Fergie is unconscious. Dredd, awakened by the crawl 
          of a SUNBEAM over his face, stirs, looks around. 

          TWO OF THE ANGELS - NEARBY - HIS POV
          They're going through gear and equipment scavenged from the 
          shuttle wreck. We have a sense of the other Angels just O.S., 
          where we HEAR VOICES and sounds of PAIN. But these two here 
          attract our interest... especially now, when their fumbling with 
          the BLACK BOX RECORDER from the shuttle CLICKS IT ON. 

                                   SHUTTLE RECORDING

                         Special prisoner? Say again, Aspen. 
                         You're breaking up...

                         ...didn't even know he was here.

          STATIC and GUNSHOTS end the tape. 

          DREDD CAMERA PUSHES IN on him. 

                                   DREDD 
                         (sotto, to himself)
                         Rico? That's impossible...
                         
          O.S. SCREAM. Fergie wakes with a start, REACTS to the dramatic 
          shafts of sunlight raking the cathedral ceiling. 

                                   FERGIE 
                         Oh my god, I'm dead. I'm dead! 
                         (SEEING DREDD)
                         And in hell.

          NEW ANGLE
          Reverend Angel and his sons come forward, throw down the BODY of
          the Shuttle Guard they have just killed. 

                                   REVEREND ANGEL 
                         Awake. Good. 
                         (off the body) 
                         We're running out of sinners. 

                                   DREDD 
                         You have just committed murder. 
                         The penalty is death. 
                         
          Reverend Angel HITS Dredd. 

                                   REVEREND ANGEL 
                         Silence, blasphemer! You still put
                         your faith in a false Law, instead 
                         of the one True Law!

          Dredd looks at Fergie suspiciously... Pa Angel looks at him with 
          odd interest. 

                                   REVEREND ANGEL 
                         Can it be? Can it be, that from 
                         the City of the Fallen, there is 
                         one of the Faithful? 

                                   FERGIE 
                         Amen, brother! Say it! 

                                   DREDD 
                         Ah... Fergie... 

                                   REVEREND ANGEL 
                         Boys, I believe we have a Believer 
                         in the gallery. Cut him down! 

                                   FERGIE 
                         Go tell it on the Mountain! 

          FAVORING FERGIE
         
          He smiles as the Angels start to release him. 

                                   FERGIE 
                         Well, Dredd. The Law doesn't make
                         mistakes, but I'm in like a disk, 
                         and you're toast. 

                                   DREDD 
                         Actually, youre toast: I arrested 
                         the Angels far Cannibalism. 

          As Fergie's expression changes, they CUT HIM DOWN. CAMERA RAKES 
          to the Angel's campfire - and human parts roasting over it! 

                                   REVEREND ANGEL 
                         Prepare the Supplicant for 
                         Sacrifice!

                         I'm not succulent! I'm not 
                         succulent, look, I'm skin and -
                         
          CRACK! Dredd has swung his legs up, wrapped them around the 
          pole, and SNAPPED it! He and the pole fall on top of Fergie 
          and the leadmost Angels! 

          FERGIE
          Falls, dodging feet.

          WIDER
          the Angels still standing ignore Fergie, rush Dredd! Dredd 
          doesn't wait for them to reach him - he charges! He feints to 
          Pa Angel, takes out one of the boys! Two other Angels get in 
          blows - but then Dredd snatches up Fergie's half of the pole, 
          uses it like a Kendo Master! He knocks two Angels unconscious, 
          then a third - then - WHAM! He gets knocked down himself by 

          REVEREND ANGEL
          who raises the metal shaft he has used over his head - turns 
          it point downwards like a spear - and then - SLAM! He's SHOT. 

          NEW ANGLE
          Fergie, beside the dazed Dredd, looks up. A JUDGE HUNTER is 
          a short distance away, SUNLIGHT gleaming off his badge. 
          Relieved, Fergie jumps to his feet. 

                                   FERGIE 
                         I surrender! I surrender! 

                                   THIRD JUDGE HUNTER 
                         You can't.
                         
          He aims at Fergie! 

          DREDD - ON THE GROUND
          seeing this, he jumps up. 

                                   DREDD 
                         NOT 

          Another Hunter appears behind Dredd! Dredd whirls, grabs at the
          man's gun barrel. SLAM SLAM! The shots go SKYWARD!

          JUDGE HUNTER #3 - BELOW
          ignoring the unarmed Fergie, he spins, FIRES -

          DREDD
          pulls the guy he's struggling with in front of him! The BULLETS
          hit him! Dredd wrenches the weapon from the man's dying fingers
          - SHOOTS the Hunter beside Fergie!

          FERGIE
          reacts as the Hunter falls beside him, the SCANNER landing right
          front of his face.
          Dredd grabs Fergie's elbow to pull him up - but Fergie resists -
          points to the SCANNER -

          :SC: SQUAD LEADER AND COMPANION - ELSEWHERE IN RUINS
           
          Hearing the SHOTS, they race in that direction.

          :SC: INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
           
          The last two Judge Hunters run towards the continuing SHOTS and
          SOUNDS of a STRUGGLE. They climb a rubble wall, aim down
          - stop, confused.

          ANGLE - THEIR POV
           
          Their own fallen men - and his SCANNER, its back panel
          open and-wires hanging out. The scanner is replaying a
          video/audio LOOP of the previous struggle with Dredd! That's
          the "gunshots"!

          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Too late, they realize they've been had. Dredd swings in on
          a beam, KICKS one Hunter into a wall! We HEAR the man's neck
          crack! Dredd struggles hand-to-hand with the second one. They
          FALL to the Courtroom floor!
          Fergie appears with a piece of timber, tries to hit the Judge
          Hunter with it.
          The gun Dredd and the Hunter are both struggling for GOES OFF.
          The piece of WOOD EXPLODES in Fergie's hands! Dredd forces the
          gun barrel towards the Hunter - SLAM!
          He's dead. Sudden SILENCE.
          
                                   FERGIE
                         We did it! We got them all!
                         
          A SHAPE lunges up, close to CAMERA. It's one of the Hunters
          Dredd took out earlier, still alive enough to aim his weapon!
          Dredd aims his stolen one, pulls
          his trigger - CLICK! Empty! The Hunter squeezes.
          The Hunter turns - SLAM! The Hunter himself is hit! Shocked, the
          hunter gets off one last SHOT.

          REVERSE ANGLE
           
          A FIGURE silhouetted in the Courtroom door FIRES at the same
          moment. The last Hunter falls, dead. Dredd looks at the new
          arrival... his hat... his long duster coat...

                                   DREDD
                         Fargo?
                         
          BLOOD wells on Fargo's coat.
          He's been hit. As he sags, Dredd
          and Fergie rush towards him.

          Through the window blinds we can see the distant Hall of
          Justice. We're in the Multi-media study cubicles used by the
          undergraduates. Olmeyer is at a pod.
          Pages of his yearbook tacked all over the walls. The
          Workstation PURRS while Hershey glares at him.

                         The Dance? You want me to go to

                         I've given up on the centerfold.
                         I'll settle for a date.

                         We're trying to save Judge Dredd,
                         and you're using the situation to
                         blackmail me. That's disgraceful!

                         I know. But I'll never get another

          He hits a control dramatically. The screen comes up... shows
          the PICTURE OF BABY DREDD AND PARENTS. Hershey stares at it in disbelief.

          She gropes around on the desk, finds the viewie frame with the
          foto of Dredd and Rico.

                         If this is the wrong picture, why

                         Slick ones, too... somebody must
                         have used a CGI terminal and a scan

          He looks at the image, uses the mouse.

          :SC: INT. CURSED EARTH COURTHOUSE - DUSK

          Fargo lies near the judge's bench. Dredd has dressed his wound 
          and made him as comfortable as possible. Fergie is heating
          rations from the Judge Hunter's cruiser over a fire. He brings
          soup over to Fargo. Fargo tries to swallow... can't.

                                   FARGO
                         Bury me there, under the blind lady.
                         
          Dredd doesn't understand. Fargo raises his arm, points to the
          statue of Justice weighing her scales.

                                   FARGO (CONT'D)
                         Judge or citizen - everyone got a
                         fair shake. She treated them all
                         the same.
                         (WEAKLY POINTING)
                         The jury sat there. Ordinary
                         people. Worst thing we did was take
                         justice out of their hands.

                                   DREDD
                         No. You and the first Judges...
                         you saved Mega-City.

                                   FARGO
                         Yes. And almost lost our souls.
                         (on Dredd's look)
                         It seemed like a wise idea: Create
                         the perfect Judge. Breed courage
                         - wisdom - integrity. The Janus
                         Project. We used the old Council
                         for the base material. Five DNA
                         samples were taken, two were chosen.
                         One was mine.
                         (PAUSE)
                         You were the result.

          Dredd is stunned.

                                   DREDD
                         But... but the orphanage told me
                         my parents were killed by
                         lawbreakers -- they gave me that
                         picture of them -

                                   FARGO
                         A fake. The psychs on the Janus
                         project came up with that story.
                         It was supposed to motivate you into
                         law enforcement. It worked. Both
                         times.

                                   DREDD
                         What do you mean, both times?

                                   FARGO
                         (FADING)
                         There were... two infants created
                         in the Janus lab. They were 
                         supposed to be perfect. One was: 
                         You. The other... somehow, it 
                         was... mutated. Not anything you 
                         could see...
                         (indicating his head)
                         But up here... horrible. A genetic 
                         criminal that one day just went... 
                         haywire.
                         (COUGHS)
                         Guess we weren't the sterling
                         specimens we thought.

                                   DREDD
                         I have a... brother?

                                   FARGO
                         More than a brother.
                         (PAUSE)
                         You knew him at the Academy, Dredd.
                         You Judged him. The Council Tried
                         him.

                                   DREDD
                         (STUNNED)
                         Rico?

                                   FARGO
                         He had to be put down. But I
                         wouldn't let them do that to you.
                         Griffin blackmailed me into the
                         Walk, Dredd. Don't trust him.

                                   DREDD
                         Like I trusted you?

                                   FARGO
                         I'm sorry... son.
                         
          The breath goes out of Fargo's body. He dies. Dredd stares
          at him, his world torn apart.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          Dredd stands in the fading light, withdrawn within himself.
          Fergie approaches, carrying the Remington.

                         I buried him. Except for this.
                         
          Dredd silently follows Fergie to the grave. Fergie shoves the
          Remington into the mound of earth as a marker.

          He hands The Book to Dredd. After a moment, Dredd opens it.

                                   DREDD

                         No; for Whoever Walks with the Law

          Dredd looks at the fresco on the wall. Sees the faded words:

          "LET JUSTICE BE DONE THOUGH THE WORLD PERISH."

                                   DREDD

          Dredd yanks the Remington out of Fargo's grave. We track into
          Dredd's face until it fills frame.

                                   DREDD

                         I don't. But I trust the Council.
                         When I tell them about Rico...
                         they'll listen.

          A Judge they pass peers at them, but doesn't speak.

                         Just don't get us killed, Dredd.
                         I still want that apology.

                         Although only two subjects were

                         the laboratory was equipped with

          McGruder stands, furious.

                                   MCGRUDER
                         Griffin, this is treason! You just
                         sealed your fate!

          All the Judges go for their Lawgivers. But it's too late. Rico
          OPENS FIRE on FULL AUTOMATIC.

          NEW ANGLE - FAVORING GRIFFIN

          Griffin averts his eyes from the moment he orchestrated.
          The gunfire STOPS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. Rico stands,
          smoking gun in hand.

                                   RICO
                         Who says politics is boring?

          Rico whirls, looks at

          DREDD - HIS POV - AT ANOTHER DOOR
          
          He has arrived in time to see the murders! With another SCREAM
          of fury, he LEAPS over the fallen Judge who tried to stop him
          - makes a running tackle at Rico!

          WIDER
          Dredd takes Rico to the floor. They both roll over and over.

                                   DREDD
                         MURDERING SON OF A BITCH - !

          GRIFFIN
          tries to get a shot at Dredd, can't. Then Griffin hears ALARMS,
          SHOUTS, running footsteps. Griffin steps quickly in, KICKS
          Dredd in the head.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         (TO RICO)
                         Get out of here, now!
                         
          Hearing people coming, Rico obeys.

          FAVORING DREDD
          He shakes his head, gets up - sees Rico is gone, but Griffin is
          close. Moves forward -

                                   DREDD
                         You're mine.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Really?
                         
          At this moment we think he's going to shoot. Then he turns his gun,
          points it at his own arm - fires!

          DREDD
          overthrown by the maneuver, he hesitates. Behind, him, the
          Judge Hunters rush in, see the shocking scene: The dead council,
          and the wounded Chief Justice clutching at his own bloody arm -

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Stop him! He just killed the entire
                         council!
                         
          Dredd realizes he's fucked. He turns, runs. The Judge Hunters
          pause near their wounded leader, who bravely waves them on.
          They tear after Dredd like wolves.

          :SC: INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          Dredd tears around the corner! Fergie appears from behind the
          hiding place he ducked into at the first shots!

                         Dredd! Tell them I'm innocent!

          BULLETS rip up the wall, just missing him. Dredd grabs him by
          the collar and they both CRASH through doors marked "ACADEMY
          AND CLASSROOMS".

          :SC: INT. ACADEMY TRAINING CENTER - NIGHT

          BULLETS whiz past Dredd and Fergie's heads. They turn another
          corner, surprise a NIGHT WATCHMAN engaged in the ancient night
          watchman pursuit of eating a sandwich and reading a girlie
          magazine.

                                   NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         Hey - !
                         
          That's all he gets out. Dredd hi-blocks him, barrels past.

          THE WATCHMAN
          falls, dazed. His stiff, plastic paged copy of "MEGA-SEX" lands
          on the floor, a 3-D animated holo pinup still posing above the
          open pages.

          :SC: WITH DREDD AND FERGIE - INDOOR TRAINING CENTER - NIGHT
          
          They enter the training center and Dredd runs right towards the
          Mark IV Lawmaster! Leaps into the saddle and kicks over the
          engine! Spins around and heads back the way he came, grabbing
          Fergie en route!

          :SC: INT. TRAINING CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          The watchman gets up in time to almost be run over. Dredd
          drives past him just as the pursuing guards appear here.
          Dredd drives directly at them! They scatter! He turns again
          towards a wide open corridor - but the Judge Hunters appear
          there, and they're smart enough to take cover behind the
          archway, and pour on an awesome fusillade!

          DREDD
          Turns again - he's flanked! He spins on the bike, takes the
          only direction left: Back into the training room - a dead end.
          All the Judges and Guards follow, BLASTING away.

          ON THE BIKE - WITH DREDD AND FERGIE - MOVING
          He races directly for the WALL! His fingers stretch out, hit
          a control marked "CANNON".

          Dredd hits the button marked "AERIAL MODE". There's a BEEP and
          the SOUND FX we heard earlier... when the flying prototype
          failed.

                                   DREDD

          The indifferent half hearted SOUND of the Aerial Mode lifters
          isn't encouraging. They just GROAN.

          :SC: EXT. JUDGE'S COMPLEX - NIGHT

          Dredd and Fergie fly out of the building on the Lawmaster Mark IV.
          Barely hanging on, they fall silently through the air,
          spinning all around them.
          The bike begins to turn a somersault.

                                   DREDD(CONT'D)

          And then, the Aerial Mode Lifters kick in with an EERIE WHINE.
          The falling motorcycle comes out of its roll wit a BLAST of
          rockets - and roars upwards!

          :SC: INT. ACADEMY TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT
          The Judge Hunters REACT as the bike disappears in an instant,
          streaking across the sky like a comet!

          A MEDIC leaves. Griffin, bandaged, turns as Rico comes out of

                         Why didn't you kill him when you

                         It's better with him on the loose.

                         That may present some legal
                         difficulties, since Judge Rico
                         killed the entire Council of Judges.

          Very carefully, Dredd and Fergie walk down the corridor.
          Dredd's still in the stolen uniform. They come to a nameplate
          with Hershey's name on it. We WIDEN. The door has been forced
          open.

          Dredd and Fergie look at each ether. Dredd swings the Remington
          out of hiding, steps inside.

          :SC: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          A total wreck. Electronic equipment still SIZZLES here. Dredd
          lifts a viewie of Hershey and some friends from the Academy.
          The three women LAUGH and wave as he touches it.

                                   FERGIE
                         I guess you're out of friends,

          NEW ANGLE
          
          Hershey, weapon in hand, steps inside. She's battered, beat
          up, and edgy. The way the light hits the room she can only see
          one figure.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Up against the wall, now!
                         
          The figure complies. It's Fergie.

          For a moment she's elated. Then her face hardens. She holds
          on steady.

                         Hershey. What is it - ?

                         They're dying out-there, Dredd.
                         A hundred and eight Judges in 48
                         hours. Everyone who's left is on
                         triple shifts and pseudorphin. I
                         thought it was organized criminals,
                         revolutionaries, something... then
                         I was a target.

                                   DREDD
                         You think I'm part of this -

                         I don't know what to think anymore.
                         
          Dredd moves like lightning - pins her gun hand against the wall
          - then freezes. It's a challenge, not a threat. She glares
          at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But
          Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's
          deliberate check-mate on both their parts.

                                   DREDD
                         (QUIETLY)
                         Do you really think I'd hurt you?

                         Secrets can hurt more than anything.
                         
          She relaxes her hold on him. Throws something down.

          NEW ANGLE
          It's the picture of Dredd and Rico.

                         believe in you again the way I did
                         when I defended you.

                         (SLOWLY)
                         His name is Rico. And he killed
                         like this once before, nine years
                         ago.

                                   HERSHEY
                         And he's doing it again?

                         Him... and Griffin.

                         Griffin? We have to tell the

                         There is no Council, Hershey: They
                         were all murdered an hour ago.

          HERSHEY
          She's been on her feet for days and this is the last psychic
          blow. She sags. Dredd catches her.

          Hershey is on what's left of the bed. She holds a cup of
          coffee, more interested in its warmth than its contents. Dredd
          is nearby. With the borrowed helmet off, we see how haggard
          he looks. In the other room, Fergie putters with the wrecked
          computer.

          That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks
          into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment.

                         my badge. I'm a convicted murderer.
                         I have no authority any more - no
                         legal authority.
                         
          Pause. Without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted
          emotional territory.

                         friend?
                         
          It's the most ordinary request anyone could make... anyone but
          Dredd. Hershey understands how much it means. She fights back
          tears, puts her hand on his arm.

                                   HERSHEY
                         I'd be honored.
                         
          Dredd reaches over, squeezes her hand. There's absolutely
          nothing sexual about it - and that makes it even more powerful.

                         are filed against them.

                         Fine! I'll file charges!

                         Now, we've already been over that
                         one: You're not a Judge anymore
                         and you can't file charges.
                         
          Flash of inspiration. Dredd excitedly signals Hershey.

                                   HERSHEY
                         Central. This is Judge Hershey.
                         I hereby file formal charges of
                         murder against Chief Justice Griffin
                         and Council Judge Rico. And I order
                         you to give me the location of the
                         Janus Lab so that I may personally
                         make the arrest!

                                   CENTRAL
                         Certainly, Judge Hershey. However,
                         as per Mega-City Code Section 84,
                         Paragraph "A", I need authorization
                         from the Chief Justice to arrest
                         a Council Judge. Similarly, as
                         stated in Paragraph "B", same
                         Section, I need authorization from
                         any Council Judges to arrest a Chief
                         Justice. In this case, that would
                         be Chief Judge Griffin and Council
                         Judge Rico.

                         We need permission from them to
                         arrest...them?

                                   CENTRAL
                         Basically... yes. And without their
                         authorization you cannot file
                         charges, and without charges I
                         cannot violate Security and tell
                         you the location of the Lab.

                         I hope this is finally clear...If
                         there aren't any other requests,
                         may I close this work station?
                         These last few days have been a

          The work station SHUTS DOWN. Dredd turns.

          Dredd strides down the hallway, holding Fergie up in the air.

          back to the student pod, the others right behind him. He pulls
          Hershey's sleeve.

          The first level of the city power grid comes up. Like the first
          page of the Thomas Guide, it's very general and low on detail.

                         When I was off-line a moment ago,
                         Judge Griffin asked me if I knew
                         where you were. Naturally, I told
                         him yes, and gave him your location.

          Sounds of pursuit are closer. Fergie yanks Dredd's arm. They
          leave. At the last moment, Hershey spontaneously kisses
          Olmeyer. Needless to say, he's thrilled. 

          WIDER
           
          As Dredd & Co. break to leave, they're momentarily visible in
          the bend of the corridor. SHOTS ring out. Olmeyer makes his 
          decision. He jumps into the aisle, starts FIRING.

          THE FOUR JUDGE HUNTERS
          Totally caught by surprise...they FIRE BACK for a second, but
          then Olmeyer's fusillade of RICOCHETING BULLETS sends them
          diving for cover!

          DREDD, HERSHEY AND FERGIE
          Almost at the flying cycle. Hershey hesitates at the shots.
          Dredd grimly pushes her towards the bike.

          OLMEYER
          Gun empty, he dives for cover. Three of the Judge Hunters
          barrel past and the forth cracks him over the head and kicks
          away the weapon.

          THE FLYING CYCLE
          ROARS into the sky! For the second time, the Judge Hunters are
          too late!

          WITH ONE OF THE JUDGE HUNTERS
          While his comrades radio-report, he angrily stalks back to where
          Olmeyer is sitting on the floor under guard. 

                                   JUDGE HUNTER
                         You're under arrest, cadet.

                         against you.
                         
          Woozy from the blow to the head, Olmeyer nods, pleased.

                         Can you think of a better model?
                         Sleek lines... strong chassis.

          ILSA AND GRIFFIN - TWO SHOT
          GRIFFIN pulls Rico away from her, talks in a desperate whisper.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Rico. You don't know what you're
                         doing! Software or wetware, when
                         you make reproductions, there's
                         always the danger of a defective
                         copy! The last time, there was one
                         perfect copy -

                                   RICO
                         Me.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Dredd! And one defective copy  You!
                         You had a mutation, on the Y
                         chromosone...

                                   RICO
                         Yes. A mutation that made me the
                         next step in human evolution.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         A mutation that made you a genetic
                         criminal!

                                   RICO
                         Really? What's your excuse?

                                   GRIFFIN
                         Rico, for God's sake, listen!
                         You're a defective copy yourself!
                         And now you're making more copies
                         that will be even more mutated -more
                         TWISTED -

                                   RICO
                         You're lying! All you care about
                         is control! Well, the next batch
                         of Janus Judges won't be the puppets
                         you want... they'll be my brothers
                         and sisters, mine to control!

                         sisters?

                         Why not? I'm going to breed some
                         more of me... the old fashioned way.

                                   ILSA
                         I'd like to be a fly on that wall.

                                   RICO
                         You will be.

          GRIFFIN
          Looks from Rico to Ilsa and back again, suddenly seeing them
          clearly for the first time.

                                   GRIFFIN
                         My God. I never should have
                         started this. Never. But now I'll
                         finish it...
                         
          He draws his Lawgiver! But it has barely cleared the holster
          when the ABC robot grabs Griffin's wrist! It plucks the weapon
          from his hand as if he's a child, hangs on to him!

                                   RICO
                         Griffy. You shouldn't have done
                         that. Fido is very loyal.

          The robot grabs Griffin with its other hand. He's completely
          off the ground now.

                                   GRIFFIN

                         I'm sorry, Chief Justice. The ABC
                         robot is not tied into my main
                         processor. Judge Rico has sole
                         voice control.

                                   RICO

          PAN on Rico and Ilsa, and we SEE the horrible SHADOWS on
          the wall, the screams become far, far worse.
          Rico watches with wincing amusement, like a spectator at a
          particularly rough hockey game.
          Ilsa watches with a sick fascination and awe.
          Finally the screams and horrible wrenching sounds STOP. There's
          a pause. The robot returns to position, metal hands stained.

          Drawn despite himself, he stands beside Rico, head turned up
          like his clone brother's. They never looked more alike. Dredd

          robot from head to toe...

          Rico points to the other banks of incubators.

                                   RICO
                         Our brothers and sisters will be
                         born in two hours. 60 today...
                         60 tomorrow. An endless supply of
                         perfection to guard Mega-City
                         forever.
                         (turning, earnest)
                         Dredd. I can't train them alone...
                         wide them alone. You can help me.
                         You have to help me: It's your 
                         birthright.

                                   DREDD
                         You get nothing from me, Rico.
                         You've betrayed the Law.

                                   RICO
                         You... you dare mention betrayal
                         to me? I was your friend. More
                         then a friend! I was loyal to
                         you... and you Judged me! You sent
                         me up for nine years of frozen hell
                         in Aspen! And you dare say
                         "betrayal" to me?
                         
          He raises his Lawgiver, aims it between Dredd's eyes.

                         help me raise the kids.

                         When Aspen thaws, Rico. Go to hell.
                         
          Tense seconds. Rico grins boyishly, lowers the gun.

                                   RICO
                         Aw. You knew I couldn't pull the

          He steps back. His face hardens. He SHOUTS.

                         Fido!

          NEW ANGLE

          CHUNG. The pneumatic door OPENS. Limping on its bad leg, the
          robot clanks slowly into the room, still hanging onto Hershey.
          Rico points at Dredd.
          
                                   RICO (cont' d)

                         Rip his arms and legs off... one
                         by one. Save his head for last.
                         
          The robot turns, clanks. Extends its free hand towards Dredd!
          Dredd backs up - into a wall! The robot keeps coming, moving
          closer. Rico and Ilsa - and then -THE ROBOT TURNS - BACKHANDS

          Drops over backwards, drops down a level! Ilsa runs
          away - and the Robot knocks her aside, too!
          
          DREDD ASTONISHED
          - until he SEES Fergie, hanging on the back of the robot,
          his hands deep inside it working its circuits!

          Now, there's one more SIZZLE and SPARK and the machine drops
          Hershey!

                                   HERSHEY
          Dredd! Catch!
          
          She throws the Remington Ilsa dropped to Dredd!

          DREDD
          whirls, FIRES down at Rico. Rico dives for cover... manages
          to grab his Lawgiver! He FIRES back up at Dredd!

          ILSA
          jumps to her feet - right into Hershey's fist!

          FERGIE
          hangs on to the robot as it staggers around, trying to regain
          control of its own movements. It stumbles back out into the
          corridor. Fergie sees it's reaching for him! Desperate, Fergie
          reaches into the robot as far as he can, throws a SWITCH! ZAP!

          THE ROBOT - NEW ANGLE
          PUNCHES its own FIST into its BRAIN. The head EXPLODES.

          FERGIE
          hits the floor, hard. Something inside him breaks. But he
          still has enough strength to look up and SEE

          ROBOT - HIS POV
          SMOKE billows from its head. Fist still buried to the wrist in
          a bizarre salute, it SLOWLY TOPPLES. CRASH!

          Fergie slumps... lies still.

          CUT TO:

          ILSA AND HERSHEY
          Continue to struggle hand to hand. Ilsa breaks free - goes into
          her blurring Karate moves - finishes as always with a savage
          KICKK to the crotch -

          HERSHEY - TILT UP FROM HER GROIN
          Hershey just grins.

                                   HERSHEY
                         You don't fight girls much, do you?
                         
          She grabs Ilsa's ankle, flips her!

          RESUME DREDD
          He's trying to keep Rico at bay, but he's clearly outgunned.
          Reloading behind cover, he SEES Fergie in the doorway. Crawls
          over to him. Fergie's ashen, his shirt soaked with blood.

                                   DREDD

          He dies. Dredd closes his eyes. CAMERA TIGHTENS on Dredd as
          his face fills with fury. He SEES Hershey's Lawgiver on the
          floor. Snatches it up! We CRANE UP with him as he COCKS it.

                                   DREDD
                         RICOOOOOO!

          WITH DREDD - RUSHING FORWARD
          He's a one man mobile artillery charge, AIMING, FIRING and
          shouting commands to his computerized weapon!

          It's like a fireworks display as round after round of special
          bullet roars from Dredd's weapon, whirling all over the room!
          Mind totally blown, Rico tries to aim, but then the BULLETS
          start to seek him out! He turns...runs!

          WITH RICO

          He DIVES behind some consoles! Armor Piercing rounds chase
          him, punching holes just above his head. Equipment SPARKS and
          SMOKES. Rico takes cover, lowers his voice.

          CAMERA RAKES
          to the incubators. They begin to open.

          DREDD
          DUCKS as he passes a smoking CONSOLE. Moves forward, feet
          CRUNCHING on glass.

          HERSHEY AND ILSA
          they roll into the workshop area. Ilsa grabs a wrench - smashes it overhead
          Hershey!
          Hershey falls! Ilsa turns, KICKS her! Hershey
          tries to get to he feet. Ilsa moves in, ready to deliver the
          final blow. And then - she SCREAMS.

          NEW ANGLE
          A CLONE is oozing out of an incubator right in front of her
          face!
          Raw bone! It's half formed, raw muscle and sinew barely covering it.

          WIDER
          In shock, Ilsa backs away - drops the wrench! The clone,
          clumsy, FALLS. Hershey recoils from it in shock - recovers her
          wits - and tackles Ilsa!
           
          DREDD
          fumbling along in the smoke. Suddenly another half-formed CLONE
          rears up in his face! It mews horribly, clutches at him! Dredd
          FIRES a burst at it. It fades away, vanishes in the smoke! 

          RICO
          whirls at the SHOT. FIRES at the muzzle flash! We HEAR a 
          GROAN and a THUD. Grinning, Rico races in that direction. 

                                
          HERSHEY AND ILSA
          still fighting. Ilsa gets in one, two terrific blows.

          He rushes forward, elated. TILT DOWN to the body. It's one of

          HE DIVES down on Rico! Each man grabs each other's wrists! 
          The Lawgivers both FIRE wildly. Dredd and Rico carom off 
          , FALL! 

          WIDER

          A short stairwell breaks their fall - and separates them at the 
          bottom! Rico rolls to his knees - still armed. Dredd is slowly 
          coming towards him - unarmed!

          He FIRES!

          DREDD
          The round HITS HIM like a pile driver! His SHIRT catches FIRE!
          He falls backwards over a railing as the SMOKE coils upwards!

          HUNK. The lights GO OUT. Rico grins, runs out of SHOT!

          ILSA AND HERSHEY
          Surprised by the darkness, Ilsa falls, sliding on the slick
          floor. TILT up. Hershey, limping, comes towards her.
          Ilsa foot-sweeps her to the floor!

          CUT TO:

          DREDD
          On the floor below, chest blackened, trying to catch his breath.
          He REACTS as the lights go out. Seeing a LIGHT in the smoke, he
          crawls to it. His face falls when he sees its one of Central's
          EYES.

                                   DREDD

                         up to Chief Justice Rico. Where
                         is he?

                         Oh, he went upstairs.

          out of reach!

          LONG SHOT
          High above the city, they trade punches! For a moment, Dredd

          chest wound! Dredd almost folds!


          CLOSE AGAIN
          Rico's almost as exhausted as Dredd. On the other hand...
          Dredd is in agony.

                         for telling you the truth? That 
                         we were born with a destiny to rule! 
                         A destiny you spit on!
                         
          Rico hits him on the wound again! Dredd falls, rolls to the
          edge of the rubble strewn platform. Rico grins, struggles to 
          full height.
           
                                   RICO (cont' d)
                         (CATCHING BREATH)
                         Joseph Dredd. I hereby Judge you. 
                         To the charge of betraying your best
                         friend... GUILTY. To the charge
                         of betraying your flesh... GUILTY.
                         
          Rico leans over the helpless Dredd. KICKS him. Dredd slips
          over the edge, dangles!

                                   RICO
                         And finally... to the charge of
                         being human when you could have been
                         a God... GUILTY.
                         
          Rico nicks up the Lawgiver. Puts it right against Dredd's head.

                                   RICO(CONT'D)
                         The sentence is DEATH!

                                   GUN VOICE
                         All lethal rounds exhausted.

          UP ANGLE
          
          Dredd dares everything, GRABS Rico's HAND! Dredd's finger makes
          contact with the pistol grip.

                                   GUN VOICE
                         DNA accepted. Select.

                                   DREDD
                         Signal Flare!
                         
          And as he SHOUTS it, he uses his last strength to smack the
          weapon away!

          WIDER

          The SIGNAL FLARE ROUND FIRES, like a ROCKET! Rico, off-balance,
          is knocked backwards! He falls SCREAMING to his death!

          CLOSE ON DREDD
          
          He watches his brother fall. Starts to climb up... a boot steps
          on his hand. He looks up.
          
          ILSA
           
          bruised, bloody - angry! Then - WHAM! A FIST SMASHES into her
          haw!

          WIDER 
          Ilsa falls next to the Lawmaster IV. Hershey reaches down for
          Dredd's hand.

          CUT TO:
          :SC: DREDD AND HERSHEY - AT THE PNEUMATIC DOOR - LOWER LEVEL
          
          Ilsa, cuffed, is on the floor, unconscious. Hershey helps
          support Dredd. They look at each other. Dredd looks back in
          the lab. Nods at Hershey. She raises her weapon. Speaks into

                                   HERSHEY
                         Grenade.
                         
          BLAM! The incubators EXPLODE.

          WIDE
          
          CHAIN REACTION spreads through the lab. One by one, consoles
          and work stations ERUPT. The unborn clones SCREAM soundlessly
          as they burn.
          
          THE DOOR.
          
          Weary, Dredd closes it. As it BLOCKS his FACE we GO TO -

          :SC: EXT. BASE OF STATUE OF LIBERTY - NIGHT

          A CIRCLE OF LIGHT FORMS around Rico's body. We WIDEN. A squad
          of JUDGE HUNTERS has appeared on Lawmasters. Dredd and Hershey
          come into view.

                                   DREDD
                         (to them)..
                         It's over.

                                   OLMEYER'S VOICE 
                         They know, Judge Dredd.

          NEW ANGLE
          
          Olmeyer is with them, a little banged up. 
           
                                   OLMEYER(cont'd) 
                         They know, now.
                         
          The Judge Hunters put away their weapons. The leader approaches
          Dredd, salutes.

                                   JUDGE HUNTER LEADER
                         You saved Mega-City, sir. You're
                         a hero.

                                   DREDD
                         No. Just a Judge. I did my job.
                         
          CAMERA ADJUSTS and we SEE that he is holding Fergie's body in
          his arms.

                                   DREDD(CONT'D)
                         Here's your hero.
                         
          The other Judges take Fergie's body respectfully. Hershey and 
          Olmeyer approach Dredd. 

                                   OLMEYER 
                         We have to reconstitute the Council, 
                         Judge Dredd. You should be on it.
                         
          He doesn't look convinced. Hershey, even less so. 

                                   HERSHEY
                         No. That's not for him. 
                         (TURNING) 
                         This is for him. 

          CAMERA ADJUSTS. Olmeyer is holding Dredd's helmet. Hershey 
          takes it, puts it on Dredd. For a moment the shot matches the 
          one of Fargo and the two cadets just before his Long Walk. 
          And then Dredd, too, turns and walks. Not into the wilderness: 
          Into his City. As the CAMERA CRANES UP, we 

          FADE OUT.

          THE END
