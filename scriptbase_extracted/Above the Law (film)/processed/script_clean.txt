    :SC: ABOVE THE LAW

    FADE IN:
    TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE

    PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
    various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
    wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
    in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
    grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
    name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
    Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
    being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
    martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
    few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
    clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
    Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
    FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

    DISSOLVE TO:
    EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
    CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
    SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
    whips in the fierce downdraft as --
    "HUEY" GUNSHIP
    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
    lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
    wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
    machine gun positions around the LZ.
    EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
    and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
    jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."

    HELICOPTER
    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
    their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
    -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
    ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.

    LEADER OF THREE

    wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.
    NICO AND FOX

    don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.


                                FOX
                You ever see chemical interrogation
                before?

    Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON,
    for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
                                NICO
                These assholes are agency?

    NICO'S POV
    FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.

    BACK TO FOX AND NICO
                                FOX
                We're all C.I.A. But these guys are
                from a page that ain't on the map.
    EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
    Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
    Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
    We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader
    and totally at home   in the jungle.
    TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
    snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
    let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
                                ZAGON
                How long till we're across the border?
                                NICO
                We've been over for the past hour.
    The group continues along the ridge.

    CUT TO:
    EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

    The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
    NICO

    listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
    at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
                                ZAGON
                What are you looking at, hotshot?

                                NICO
                (indicates cigarette
                glow)
                Why don't you light a bonfire?


    Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
                                ZAGON
                Just drive the taxi, ace.

    As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
    "Don't fuck with these guys."

    EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT

    A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
    several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
    through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
    100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
                                FOX
                (to Zagon)
                They're in there.

    The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
    glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
                                NICO
                I don't trust these yo-yo's.
    FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
    We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
    to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
    ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.

    DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
    hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
    NICO'S POV - HOOCH
    Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
    coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
    guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
    heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
    gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.

    BACK TO NICO
    He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
    hooch.

    INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
    on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
    and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
    squirt-tests it.


    TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
    are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
    tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
    hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
    first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
    prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
    Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.

                                ZAGON
                That's the nice thing about modern
                technology. You don't have to wait
                for results.

    He moves close to the first prisoner.
                                ZAGON
                (to first prisoner)
                Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
                of our shit --
    The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
    that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
    EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO

    hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the
    hooch --
    INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER

    has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
    referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
    Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
                                ZAGON
                Don't you die on me, fucker --
                                FOX
                (from the side)
                What the hell's wrong?
                                ZAGON
                (throws the prisoner
                down)
                This pussy can't hold his liquor.

    The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.

    NICO
    enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
    to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,
    but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if
    he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
    it to the others, too.

    FIRST PRISONER
    dies in agony on the ground.

    SECOND PRISONER
    watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
    scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
    higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
    since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
    customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
    daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
    prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
    back down an inch.
                                ZAGON
                (to second prisoner)
                So my little doctor bag doesn't                      
                scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     
                it to open your yap.                                 
    Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
    fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
    a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
    blade in the lantern light.

    NICO
    watches impassively.
                                ZAGON (O.S.)
                (to prisoner)
                Where's our load, you sack of slime?
                What did you do with my shit? --
    ZAGON
    punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
    handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
    terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
    crashes  sideways, face bloody --
                                ZAGON
                I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna
                teach you never to fuck with my
                opium --

    FOX AND TWO CIT MEN

    seem to know exactly what this is about.
    NICO

    didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.
    Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
    over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.


    prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
    with defiance --

                                ZAGON
                (to prisoner)
                You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
                You took it from the Chinks... you took
                it from the French. You'll be fucked
                if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
                your gums flapping --
    watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
    prisoner.

                                ZAGON
                -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,
                tough guy. You're gonna sing like a
                choir --

    takes a step toward Zagon.
                                NICO
                What the fuck does this have to do
                with military intelligence?
                                ZAGON
                Your orders are 'assist and observe'
                cherry --
    turns to face Nico --

                                FOX
                (to Nico)
                Back off, partner --
    turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
    as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
                                ZAGON
                (to second prisoner)
                I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
                We'll throw your feet in that box right
                over there. Then I'm gonna take off
                your arms --
    of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
    to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
    He seems as locked into this dance of death as
    Zagon.
                                NICO
                (can't take
                much more)
                Fox --
                                FOX
                Shut up, Nico.


                                ZAGON
                You can disappear as easy as this
                slope, kid --

    Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
    Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
    terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
    Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
    ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
    comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
    in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
    move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
    his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
    out of the hooch --
    EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT

    Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

                                FOX
                Are you crazy?!!
                (as Nico jerks free)
                What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
    Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
    away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
    .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
    hooch --
                                FOX
                Nico!
                                NICO
                I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
                later.

    The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
    Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --

                                FOX
                I'll cover this. Get back to the
                L.Z. --
                (as Nico resists)
                -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
                fuck outa here!
    The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
    pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
    seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
    apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
    troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

                                FOX
                (to Nico)
                I'll call for a chopper... get outa
                here!

    Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
    trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
    Nico disappears into the darkness.

    FADE TO BLACK.
    FADE IN ON:

    CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY

    TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in
    an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks
    festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,
    then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if
    they're late --
    INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY

    A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
    last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        
    -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
    final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
    straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
    around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
    relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
    uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
    with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
    garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
    all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm
    around Sara.                                                  

    EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
    Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the
    sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is
    poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are
    everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
    the party has come here straight from the church. Presents
    for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        
    and Nico's mother, ROSA.
                                SARA                                   
                Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.

    Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.                                 
                                ROSA
                Nico had one just like this.   Thank
                you, Cora.
    Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.

    NICO

    Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped
    in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.                       

                                NICO
                I think we got a little problem here.

                                SARA                                  
                (winking at the women)
                I carried him for the last nine months,
                you take him for the next diaper.

    Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries
    awkwardly to deal with the problem.
                                NICO
                (to all)
                That's what you get for not marrying a
                Sicilian.
    Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               

                                SARA                                     
                My brave husband. He's not afraid of
                thieves and muggers, but he's terrified
                when his son poops in his pants.
    Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple
    and their baby.

    ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD
    Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes
    and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies
    while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
                                LUKICH
                (indicates Nico
                across the patio)
                Toscani holds the record... for havin'
                more relatives under federal indictment
                than any other cop in Chicago.

    TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES
    BRANCA and LUIGI, who   look like they have been on the other
    side of a cop's work,   are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson
    -- plus a cluster of   other cops in civvies hovering around
    the buffet table like   vultures.
                                BRANCA
                Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal
                and they come out like flies.
    STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY

    An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON ("Jax"),
    another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters
    the driveway leading to Nico's back yard --

    BACK YARD
    Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates
    intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson,
    Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
                                STROZAH
                I didn't do nothing, Counselor.    I'm
                clean.

                                JACKSON
                Eight more days, Lieutenant. You
                better start preparing your defense.

                                HENDERSON
                Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.

                                LUKICH
                You passed the bar? I make it a
                point never to pass the bar.
    Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          
    starts toward them --
    BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI

    Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
                                LUIGI
                Now this cop.    She can bust me any
                day.
    NICK, SARA AND ROSA (NICO'S MOTHER)                            
    Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's
    stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly.      
    She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.
    VARIOUS SHOTS

    Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father
    Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's
    friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of
    varied ages and professions.
    BACK TO JACKSON

    Holding the baby.

                                JACKSON
                Look at this little bundle.    What a
                cupcake!

                                NICO
                You give up being the D.A. and hurry
                up and find the right fella, Jax.
                You might have time for one of these
                yourself.

                                SARA                                    
                Nico, will you let the woman
                catch her breath?

    JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE)                                  
    moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson
    and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward      
    Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.                 

                                NICO
                Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc.

    They begin jabbering in Japanese.
    We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking      
    woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and   
    intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who
    go back a long way.

    EXT. TOSCANI FRONT PORCH - LATER
    Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke
    cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.

                                BRANCA
                You're a father now. Are you gonna
                take me up on my offer?

                                NICO
                I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do.
    Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a
    smile, pats Nico's cheek.
                                BRANCA
                Look at this face! Six-foot-four,
                pretty as the statue of David. And
                he's a cop!
    Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing
    nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops
    observe and try to listen.
                                BRANCA
                This face should be sticking up from
                a white shirt. It should be a banker,
                a businessman, someone who earns a
                decent living for his family!
                                NICO
                We're happy.
                                LUIGI
                Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a
                woman with class. What did she run
                -- a ballet school...?
                                NICO
                An art gallery.
                                BRANCA
                Same thing. She wants a husband who
                carries a briefcase, not a shoulder
                holster.
    Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This
    is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes
    meet Nico's.

                                BRANCA
                You wanted to get shot, you got shot.
                You wanted to get knifed, you got
                knifed. You've had your fun. Basta!
                Enough!
                                UNCLE GUISEPPE
                Let your family help you, Nico.

                                NICO
                (lightly)
                Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't
                need. I'd rather get shot by someone
                I don't know.
    Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the
    moment, the tension is dispelled.

    INT. NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY
    Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder
    holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother
    standing near the head of the stairs, just outside
    another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
                                NICO
                What are you doing in here, Mama?
                Go join the party...
    Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops
    to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom:
    the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in.
    INT. NURSERY - DAY                                           
    Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish   
    grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He
    kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.

                                NICO
                Mrs. Z.
                (tries to be light)
                Is this a way to act on the day of
                my son's baptism?
    The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.

                                SARA                                
                It's Lucy.   She's gone again.
    Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              

    Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico
    holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            
                                NICO
                It's that kid from the bar on Damen?
                The one with the drugs?

    Sara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   
    another moment, then stands.

                                NICO
                Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you
                listening?
                (as the woman nods
                miserably)
                I have to go to work now. But
                I'll come by tonight. You'll be
                at the bakery?
                                MRS. ZINGARO
                Si, Nico.
                                NICO
                We'll talk, okay? We'll find a
                way to take care of this.

    Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         
    starts for the door.
    EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
    Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through,
    nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells.
    Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.
    INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING
    Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio.
                                JACKSON

    EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CAR

    moves into the central city.
    POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING

    Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners.
                                NICO (O.S.)
                I promised the Lieutenant, I'm
                gonna take care of you. Broken
                windows and lost kittens for your

    WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson.

                                JACKSON
                And then you're gonna come visit
                me in a nice, clean, air conditioned
                office --

    EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                        
    The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar.

    INT. UNMARKED CAR
    as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look:     "What are we
    stopping at this dive for"?

                                NICO
                I gotta take a quick leak. Stay
                put.

    He gets out of the car, starts for the bar.
    INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 

    Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico
    enters.

    His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
    class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
    subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
    photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.

                                BAD DUDE                                 
                Why the fuck don't you assholes                        
                leave me alone?                                        

    He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     
    then another; the same exchange is repeated.
    FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           

    A hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as --
    NICO

    approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly.
    Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.
                                NICO
                Gentlemen.
    One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins
    to pick his nose.
                                FIRST ARMY JACKET
                (to others)
                I thought this was a kosher bar.
                They didn't allow no pork in here.
    The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar.
    Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy).
                                NICO
                You seen this girl?
                                SECOND ARMY JACKET
                I seen the top of her head.
                                NICO
                That's witty.


    takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
    From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          
    baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         
    toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     
    too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
    of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
    slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
    his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
    He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
    shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
    head over heels, out over the bar and careening
    the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
    put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
    Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.
    Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-
    his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --

                                NICO
                Come on.   Show me something.
    one moves.

                                NICO
                I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is
                that it?

    The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
    Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his
    hand. He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap-
    ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.

                                NICO
                You seen the top of her head, huh?
                Like I seen your mother's --
                (to another guy)
                Or was it yours?
                (to a third)
                Or yours?
                (slaps him fero-
                ciously)
                I couldn't tell, it looked like
                her ass --
    Nico rages like a beast.
                                NICO
                Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it.
                Do it! One man --
    Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about
    to tear his face off --
                                BAD DUDE
                Upstairs!
                (in terror)
                She's upstairs! 4-D!
    Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him,
    Nico turns, glowering, to all.
                                NICO
                You cocksuckers are brave enough
                with 14-year-old girls.
    INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAY

    Nico throws Bad Dude down the hallway in front of him.
    INT. FOURTH-FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

    The door bursts in from a jackhammer kick. Nico stands
    in the hallway. Bad Dude stands next to him; hurt,
    shaking.

                                NICO
                (to Bad Dude)
                Get outta here.
    We look in the apartment.


    - NICO'S POV                                           
    young PIMP -- quite  handsome in a boyish way -- stares up
    panic from a grimy  mattress on the floor. Little LUCY
    in bra and panties,  strung out, 14 and beautiful.
    and free-base  paraphernalia are on a table.
    IN DOORWAY

                This ain't your day, kid.

    comes in, eyes taking in everything.

                                PIMP
                Wait, man.   It ain't like it
                looks --

    Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him
    bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the
    Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the
    table --

                                NICO
                That's two years.
    He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer.    More pills
    and glacene bags.
                                NICO
                That's four.

                neck toward   Lucy)
                She'll get you eight   more. And
                I'm just warming up   --
    Lucy is crying hysterically. Nico flings the Pimp, face          
    bloody, toward the open door.                                    
                                PIMP

    QUICK CUTAWAY TO:
    EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - JACKSON

    Three young STUDS have ambled to the window of her parked
    car.
                                STUD
                Hey, sister, what it be?

    With infinite boredom, Jackson lifts her badge -- and
    gun. The Studs shuffle away.

    INT. HALLWAY - DAY

    Other tenants stare from doorways as Nico drags the Pimp         
    to the top of the flight of stairs, threatening to throw         
    him down.

                Don't you fuckin' move.                           

    steps back into the apartment, hauls out Lucy in      
    dressing gown.

    TOP OF LANDING                                             
    The Pimp is dazed, bloody. Nico comes down with Lucy,
    hauls the Pimp to his feet --

                                LUCY
                Let him alone! He's beautiful!

                                NICO
                Not when I get through with him.
    Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall.

                                PIMP
                No, man, wait! I'll give you
                something! Something big!

                This is square! On my mother's
                soul! You can't send me up --
    Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the
    Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor
    girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop
    -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level.
                                PIMP
                I heard it from a hooker friend
                of mine. She's banging some big
                coke lawyer, he told her. I swear
                to Jesus!

    Nico relents -- a little.
                                NICO
                What lawyer?

                                PIMP
                I don't know.
                (sees Nico doesn't
                believe him)
                That platinum chola... Carla
                DeCarlo... she knows.
    Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat.

                                PIMP
                She got popped this afternoon.
                She's downtown. Red dress, lizard
                shoes --

    EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BAR - DAY
    Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired,
    shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent
    apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked,
    wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out
    of the car, moving to Lucy.

                                JACKSON
                It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is
                here.

    She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car.

                                JACKSON
                (to Nico)
                That was some leak you took.
    From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek.
                                JACKSON
                Broken windows and lost pussy cats,
                huh.
    Jackson checks out her battered partner.

                                JACKSON
                You're one crazy bastard, Toscani.
    Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in.

                                NICO
                We'll get her some clothes and a
                bath. I'm not bringing her home
                to her grandmother like this.
    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT. ZINGARO BAKERY - DAY

    From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy,
    in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico
    walks her inside.

    The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking.
    Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive
    their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they
    thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson,
    standing in the doorway, has seen all this.
    INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

    Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery.
    Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a
    few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this
    man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath
    an out-and-out wild man.

                                JACKSON
                I don't get you, Toscani.
                (beat)
                What the hell are you doing being a
                shitheel cop? With your background?
    For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look-
    ing straight ahead:
                                NICO
                When I was overseas, I saw some
                things. Things that eat your guts
                out. Things that stay in front of
                your eyes like they were burned in
                and branded.
    He turns to Jackson.
                                NICO
                You can walk away from them, Jax.
                You can quit, but you know it's
                still going on. You try something
                anyway --
                (smiles a moment)
                -- I know I'm not going to change
                the world. I can't stop the tonnage
                coming in, I can't fight the boys
                behind the desks pushing their
                buttons --

    ANGLE INCLUDING MEAN STREETS OUTSIDE
                                NICO
                But maybe here, huh?
                (indicates street)
                Maybe in my own city, my own
                neighborhood, on my own block --
                maybe here I can do something.

    He turns a corner.
                                NICO
                That's why I'm a shitheel cop.

    INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
    Behind the desk, a few detectives man the phones.   A Latin
    attorney, ABANDANO, is at the counter.

                                COP (O.S.)
                You can see your client. As soon
                as she's through eating her dinner.

    INT. POLICE LOCKUP - "CAGE" AND HALLWAY - EVENING
    Hookers, female addicts, etc. in the downtown "cage."
    Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes
    (CARLA DECARLO) out in the hallway adjacent to the lock-
    up. Nico is Mr. Charm, offering her a heart-shaped box
    of chocolates.

                                NICO
                Carla... Carla -- I just want the
                name of your boyfriend --
                                CARLA
                I got 200 boyfriends.
    The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in
    Spanish.


                                CARLA
                Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!

    Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the
    detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con-
    tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands
    with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as
    a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being
    flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico
    heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench
    next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker.
    It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street-
    walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt.

                                JACKSON
                (to Nico)
                Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever
                treat someone with a little
                respect?
                                NICO
                (walking away)
                Take it easy, sister.
                                JACKSON
                I ain't your goddamn sister.   We
                ain't got the same mother,
                motherfucka.
    Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then
    sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson
    comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted.
    CUT TO:
    EXT. DOWNTOWN - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
    Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a
    building. She gets into Nico's car.

    INT. CAR - DAY
    Jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror. Nico
    sits behind the wheel. The two are on some kind of
    stakeout.
                                JACKSON
                The lawyer's name is Abandano.
                He's on the third floor. I got a
                look at him. I couldn't get how
                he's connected, but according to
                Carla, he's a lousy lay.

                                NICO
                Maybe we can bust him for that.
    Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --

    EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - DAY
    A short, slick-looking Latin man in a business suit emerges
    from the building.

                                JACKSON
                That's our stud.

    Nico and Jackson leave their car and follow him on foot.

    EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BANK - DAY
    ABANDANO meets a striking-looking middle-aged woman in front
    of a stately financial institution. They go in. Jackson
    remains out on the street, while Nico follows the couple in.
    LATER

    Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee. Nico
    emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow
    him. Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol-
    ving doors and immediately jump into a cab. Nico and
    Jackson look at each other and step in front of another
    cab. Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then
    asks the occupant to leave. Jackson gets in the front
    seat next to the protesting cabbie.
    EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY
    Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and
    Jackson run up the block. Near the entrance to the Federal     
    Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are            
    gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus-       
    trated cabbie watches them in the background.
    PLAZA
    Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the        
    crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson acts 
    indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something.

    INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT ("BOGOTA") - DAY                     
    The main dining room. No customers, just busboys readying
    tables for the evening's business. We notice one of the        
    busboys is the "pimp" Nico found with Lucy.                    

    BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY
    The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox
    and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA
    SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux
    with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus-
    cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like
    he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The
    busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic --

                                SALVANO
                (pissed off)
                -- I brought you in for your
                muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.

                                NARDO
                (scared)
                I'm sorry, boss.

                                SALVANO
                Your English is getting good...
                You're showing it off. Showing it
                off on the street --

                                NARDO
                I keep quiet.    I never talk no
                more --

    Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him.
    Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy --
    then releases him, as if all is forgiven.
                                SALVANO
                Make yourself useful.
                (indicates empty
                wine bottle on
                table)
                Get downstairs, bring me one of
                these.
                (as Nardo stands,
                starts for back
                hallway)
                Then get back to work.
    INT. RESTAURANT BASEMENT STOREROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

    Nardo enters at the top of the stairs, radiating relief.
    He trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor-to-
    ceiling wine rack.

                                NARDO
                (to himself)
                I thought I was dead, man.
                (whistles with
                relief)
                I thought I was fucking dead.

    He crosses to the wine rack. It's dark, hard to see.
    He searches for the bottle. Suddenly: a METALLIC sound
    behind him. Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry,
    pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he
    has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small
    silencer automatic.

                                CHI CHI
                You were right, cabron.                            

    One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into
    the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi
    Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly,
    professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the
    prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his
    palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano
    appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind
    him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        
    down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. 
    Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.
                                SALVANO
                (to busboys)
                Clean up this mess.
                                CHI CHI                                  
                Who knows who else is talking --                       

                                SALVANO                                  
                He was a young fool.                                   
    BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM
    Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and
    walk toward their booth.

                                CHI CHI
                We're crazy waiting for this
                bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste
                the other fucker now.

    Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder.
                                SALVANO
                Be patient. This will be done
                the way it was planned.

    Rusting cyclone fences surround   a mud-lot repair yard in a
    dingy industrial section. Young    Lation and black workers

    office window we can see Chi Chi   talking on the phone. The
    lawyer, Abandano, is also there.

    Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has
    been hastily wired to the entering phone line.

    INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

    Nico and Jackson in the shadows down the street from the

    on the seat beside him. Jackson does not look happy.

                I thought you said you were
                gonna protect me. Cover my butt.

    Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for
    silence --

                                JACKSON
                Salvano?
                                NICO
                Jackpot.

    EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
    Chi Chi and Abandano get out of their car, a valet takes it,
    Chi Chi enters the restaurant.

    INT. SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
    Nico and Jackson enter the main dining room, which we
    recognize from the scene with Nardo the busboy.


    The place is packed with fashionable people of all races.
    A band plays salsa; couples dance. Nico and Jackson pass
    easily as a hip "uptown" couple. A pretty Latin HOSTESS
    approaches them.

                                HOSTESS
                Two for dinner?

                                NICO
                Two for drinks.
    They elbow up to the packed bar, standing.   Nico squints
    toward the rear dining room.

    NICO'S POV - DOWN BAR
    Looking past numerous patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper
    something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table
    (the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before.)
    The waiter hurries off into a back hallway.
    NICO AND JACKSON - AT BAR
    Jackson moves to the salsa beat.   A BARMAID approaches.
                                JACKSON
                Gimme something stiff.   I need it.
                                BARMAID
                Who doesn't?

    Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi.
    REAR DINING ROOM
    From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux,
    looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and
    Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few
    words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket,
    hands it to Salvano.
                                NICO (O.S.)
                You'll have your engine block
                next Tuesday, boss.
    BACK TO NICO AND JACKSON

    As the Barmaid brings their drinks. Jackson sees her
    peaceful week to retirement flying out the window.
                                JACKSON
                Why couldn't it be a week from
                Tuesday? I could read about it
                in the paper.
    Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and
    does a playful twirl.

                                NICO
                Cheer up, partner.   I'm gonna
                make you famous.

    EXT. WHOLESALE MEAT AREA - DAY                               
    Track spurs, greasy streets, parked fork lifts.

    EXT. ROOF - DAY                                              

    Lieutenant Strozah surveys the street traffic.               
    NICO, JACKSON AND LUKICH

    The two men, dressed as meat processors in hard hats and
    bloody white coats, rake cattle guts under the eave of a
    packing plant. Jackson, dressed like a USDA Inspector and    
    carrying a clipboard, inspects a few hanging carcasses.

                                JACKSON
                You missed a few spots, boys.
                                LUKICH
                I'm takin' it home t'a make
                kilbasa, boss.

    Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot
    with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers"
    keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a
    seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.

                                LUKICH
                This ain't a bust -- it's a
                convention.
                                NICO
                Don't you like company, Luke?
                (sarcastic)
                We got all the scouts here --
                Drug Enforcement Agency, the
                Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms --
                                WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
                Keep this channel clear, Toscani.
    We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes
    out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick-
    up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley.
    Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice.
                                NICO
                (into mike)
                This is our channel, dickhead.
                And our collar.
                                ANOTHER WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
                That's enough, all of you! Keep
                this channel clear.

    ANGLE ON MEAT PLANT - DAY
    Nothing happening.

    ANOTHER ANGLE
    Dead as hell.

    NICO, LUKICH AND JACKSON
    Bored, pissed off, tired.   Suddenly:

    BATTERED VAN WITH TWO MEN

    emerges from a corner, two blocks down.    It starts slowly
    this way.

                                1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
                All right. Everyone get their
                heads outa their ass.

    The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men
    back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow
    guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area.
                                JACKSON
                (sarcastic)
                '... And so I quit the police
                department... got myself a steady
                job -- '
    The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes.
    Silence.
                                LUKICH                                
                They spotted me. I'm too good-
                looking to be a meat slopper.                       
                                1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
                Will you hot dogs shut up?
    The van returns.   On a cross street.   Heading behind the
    packing plant.

                                NICO                                  
                (to Lukich)                                  
                You're too ugly.

    Now a second car appears. The Lincoln. Behind it is an
    ancient station wagon. Both vehicles take a different
    cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant.

                                NICO
                (into hidden mike)
                Here we go, boys and girls --
                (to Jackson)
                You stay put.                                       

    As soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and
    Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant.
    The meat truck men START their TRUCK.


    The pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico
    and Luke -- but at a safe distance.

    INT. PACKING PLANT - DAY

    Nico and Lukich sprint in a crouch past the blood runoffs,
    meat cutting tables --

    NICO'S POV - RUNNING

    THROUGH the windows at the rear of the plant, we see the
    station wagon and the van, pulling up swiftly beside one
    another, men getting out --

    INT. PLANT
    Nico and Lukich draw their guns, running full-tilt.

                                NICO
                (into hidden miki)
                It's going down now. Move!
    EXT. REAR OF PACKING PLANT - DAY
    The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the
    van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is
    stopped at a distance. Suddenly --
    NICO AND LUKICH
    burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn.
                                LUKICH
                Police!
    QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN
    grab for their weapons --

    COPS IN MEAT TRUCK AND PICKUP
    come highballing around both sides of the packing plant --

    VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN
    OPEN FIRE. There is confusion and mayhem; it's not clear
    who's a cop and who's a criminal.

    NICO AND LUKICH
    dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck
    also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes.
    MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of
    control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.
                                LUKICH
                (shouts; points)
                Nico!   The Lincoln!


    LINCOLN
    starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi in the driver's
    seat, Salvano on the passenger side.

    NICO
    steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45.

    INT. LINCOLN - DAY
    Salvano and Chi Chi dive below the dash and continue
    forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat, raises his GUN;
    FIRES blindly -- trying to hit Nico.
    EXT. LINCOLN - DAY

    Nico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall.
    The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley.
    NICO
    brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto
    the roof.
    INT. LINCOLN - DAY
    Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in
    Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof.
    EXT. LINCOLN - ROOF - DAY
    Bullet holes appear.    Nico narrowly misses being hit.
    ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN

    Nico reaches over the side of the car and SMASHES the pas-
    senger WINDOW with his fist.

    CLOSEUP - NICO'S HAND
    Salvano's face is bashed.     Nico's huge hand grabs Salvano's
    throat; he won't let go.

    CLOSEUP - NICO
    He hangs on with one hand.

    CLOSEUP - SALVANO
    Nico's fingers now    dig into Salvano's larynx; he may never
    talk again. He's     gagging. Salvano now points the gun at
    Chi Chi. Chi Chi     makes the decision to stop the car in
    order to save his    boss.

    NICO
    leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass,
    out of the window.

    SEVERAL POLICE VEHICLES                                        
    SCREECH into the lot. Officers pour out, guns drawn,
    surrounding the Lincoln and the other vehicles. Jackson
    joins them, weapon in hand.
    NICO

    drags Salvano by the neck across the lot to the van,
    slamming the drug dealer up against the van's side.
    Lukich, Jackson and Strozah are there, with the DEA cops,      
    all covering the other men.

                                NICO
                (to Salvano)
                How many kilos you got in there,
                Skivuzo?
    Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops
    look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open,
    yanks a tarp off the cargo.
    INT. VAN
    The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped
    with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips
    the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the
    shipping frame, tears them off. In the background,
    ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops
    and criminals.

    CLOSEUP - ENGINE BLOCK
    From the cylinder heads emerges a full load, not of drugs,
    but of plastique tubes labeled U.S. ARMY C-4 HIGH EXPLOSIVE.
    LUKICH, JACKSON AND OTHER COPS

    react with surprise and shock.
    NICO

    rips open one of tubes and smells it.

    CLOSE - NICO
    Confused; frustrated.

                                NICO
                What kinda fuckin' high is this?
    CUT TO:

    INT. FBI OFFICE - NIGHT
    OPENING ON SALVANO, in a chair, looking bruised and swollen,
    and wearing an expression of fuming indignation.

                                SALVANO
                -- I'll tell you what this cop is.
                He's a fucking menace!

    TWO FBI AGENTS (NEELEY AND HALLORAN)                           
    face Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano (apparently
    representing Salvano and Chi Chi). Neeley is on the phone.     
    Pictures of Reagan and Meese are prominent on the wall.
                                SALVANO
                You see what he did to me?!

                                AGENT HALLORAN
                Your problem is being handled right
                now, Mr. Salv --
                                SALVANO
                Yeah? Well, it shoulda been
                handled twelve hours ago. I don't
                know who's running this outfit, but
                somebody better get his goddamn wires
                straight!
                                AGENT NEELEY                           
                (into phone)
                -- yes, sir... yes, sir, I understand --
                                SALVANO
                That maniac should be wearing a
                number, not a badge.
    Salvano knows what the call is about. He straightens the
    tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a
    respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged.
                                AGENT NEELEY                           
                (into phone)
                -- count on it, sir. Right.
                You'll have our full cooperation.
    Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns     
    grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano.

                                AGENT NEELEY                           
                You're free to go.

    INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT                          
    The hoods and their lawyer smugly walk past a cleaning
    woman.

    INT. PRECINCT CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
    OPENING ON Agent Neeley's face. Composed, clean-cut, but      
    intense, wearing a light-colored business suit. PAN TO
    Agent Halloran -- the same upright, clean-shaven bureau look.
    The two men are seated to one side of LIEUTENANT FRED STROZAH.
    NICO, JACKSON, LUKICH AND DEA AND ATF MEN

    sit and stand in various postures in front of the Lieutenant's
    desk.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                (to Nico, DEA & AIF)
                -- This is no reflection on the
                work you officers have done. I
                feel, and the whole department
                feels, extremely proud of your
                initiative and gallantry.
    That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's
    fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on
    the others' faces too.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                As all of you   are well aware,
                possession of   these explosives
                is a federal   offense and under
                jurisdiction   of the F.B.I.
    Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect
    between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain.
                                NICO
                Sir. With all respect to our
                brothers in the Bureau --
                (biting sarcasm;
                turns to Neeley)                            
                -- That's no answer. It's no
                answer to why one of the biggest
                dealers in the city is out on the
                street now, free as a bird!

    Agent Neeley stiffens.                                        
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                Keep it in your pants, Nico.
                These men have a job to do, just
                like us.
    Nico stifles his outrage. The other cops exchange glances
    -- upset and angry. Agent Neeley clears his throat.          

                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                Lieutenant, I think these officers
                are entitled to a fuller
                explanation.
                They've risked their lives. I
                understand one man is in the
                hospital.

    He speaks to the officers.
                                AGENT NEELEY                            
                What I'm about to say doesn't
                leave this room. Is that clear?
    Assent from everyone.

                                AGENT NEELEY                            
                Mr. Salvano has been working for
                some time in cooperation with
                certain federal agencies.

    CLOSE - NICO'S FACE
    Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up.
                                AGENT NEELEY (O.S.)                     
                I'm not at liberty to divulge
                the nature of Mr. Salvano's
                involvement -- I just learned of
                its existence myself a few hours
                ago. But one thing I can tell you --
    BACK TO AGENT NEELEY                                            

                                AGENT NEELEY                            
                Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to
                an extremely sensitive ongoing
                investigation. Any further
                surveillance, harassment, or
                unauthorized operations against
                this individual are forbidden.
                I must order you gentlemen --
                (looking straight at
                Nico)
                -- with all respect for your work
                and your courage, to stand down.

    Lukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated.     Jackson takes
    it all in.

    OPENING CLOSE ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from
    rounds of ammo, notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana
    sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled audio-
    cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging
    devices. Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the
    notes, hand them to Lieutenant Strozah.


                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                The tapes too.

                                NICO
                (mocking)
                That's my Lawrence Welk
                collection!

                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                I want everything you got on this
                one.
    Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes
    bugs and wires.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH
                I know you don't give a shit
                about yourself, Toscani.
                (a glance to Jax)
                But you're gonna put Jackson's
                ass in a sling, too, with these
                illegal wires.

    OTHER SIDE OF SQUAD ROOM
    Agent Halloran edges up to Jackson, who's grabbing coffee
    on the far side of the squad room, and watching from there
    as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                What's the story on your partner,
                Jackson? Did he learn this style
                or was he born with a brick up his
                ass?
    Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite
    herself, there's a certain rapport.
                                JACKSON
                He has ethics. Unlike certain
                others on this case.

    Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of
    Nico's drawer.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                His 'ethics' are gonna cost him
                his badge and his gun.

    This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain.   She slips into
    her jive mode.
                                JACKSON
                You don't wanna catch him without
                no gun.
    Halloran's look asks why not?
                                JACKSON
                'Cause what he do with his hands...
                make bullet holes look pretty.

    Across the room, Nico turns over the tapes.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                He bad?

                                JACKSON
                Bad bad.

    INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY
    Nico and Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had
    ample excitement for her last week on the force.

                                JACKSON
                Is that enough? Can we do
                something normal now -- like
                eat lunch?

                                NICO
                Anything you say, Jax.   How
                about Salvano's?

                                JACKSON
                Let it be, Nico.

    EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DAY

    Nico and Jackson's car pulls out into traffic.
    INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED (ALLEY BEHIND SALVANO'S)
    Jackson and Nico are eating some fast good.   Nico reaches
    to his jacket pocket; takes out a cassette.

                                JACKSON
                What... you kept his tape, too?
    Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS
    of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and
    English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care-
    fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION.
                                NICO
                Poetry, ain't it?
    EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAY (POV FROM CAR)

    The pimp (busboy) comes out and dumps a load of garbage.
    INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

    Nico and Jackson case the restaurant from down the alley.
    EXT. REAR SALVANO'S - NICO'S POV - DAY

    From the restaurant door, Salvano and Chi Chi emerge.
    They get into a black Cadillac and pull out.                 
                                NICO (O.S.)
                And now for some dessert.

    SERIES OF SHOTS
    As Nico's car tails Salvano's through various streets.

    EXT. OAK STREET
    Salvano comes out of a fancy flower shop with a bimbo on
    his arm. He kisses her goodbye and puts her in a cab.

                                NICO (O.S.)
                And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice
                to see married couples still in love.

    NICO AND JACKSON
    are hidden, waiting.

    CHI CHI
    emerges from a dry cleaner's with a suit on a hanger.         

    EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S PARISH CHURCH - DAY

    Salvano's Caddy   pulls up outside the same church where we   
    saw Nico's son   get baptized. Salvano and Chi Chi get out,
    look both ways   up and down the street. Salvano, holding     
    flowers, makes   eye contact with a car down the block.       
    EXT. STREET UP BLOCK FROM CHURCH - DAY

    Nico's car backs out of sight around the corner.
    SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH
    Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.
    INT. CHURCH - DAY
    A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and
    Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the
    altar, move in, take seats toward the front.
    BACK OF CHURCH

    Nico and Jackson slip in the front door, glide silently
    into the shadows at the rear of the church.

                                JACKSON
                This is your mother's church,
                isn't it?

                                NICO
                Yeah. But I bet she's never seen
                these boys in the choir.
    NICO'S POV

    Salvano's head is bowed, but Chi Chi is looking around
    quite carefully. Nico and Jackson fade into the shadows
    behind the huge pillars.

    SALVANO AND CHI CHI
    After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them-
    selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they
    continue to look for something.
    INT. CHURCH - DAY                                           

    Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a
    day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front
    of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their
    tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and
    look around.


                                FATHER GENARRO (O.S.)
                Nicola! That can't be you in
                church without the family!

    Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy
    sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard
    alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.

                                NICO
                Father Genarro.
    The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                This must be your partner in
                crime.
                (shakes her hand)
                I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at
                the baptismal party.
                (with a wink to Nico)
                What a partner.
                                JACKSON
                Dolores Jackson
                (smiling, but
                impatient)
                Nico, we gotta go --
                                FATHER GENARRO
                No, please --
                (more serious now)
                It's good you stopped by. I have
                to show you something. Please.
    The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps
    glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly
    driving by.
    INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

    This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an
    underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored
    along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.
    Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico
    and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.
    They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a
    break-in has taken place.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                The rats are getting bigger.
                                NICO
                When did this happen?

                                FATHER GENARRO
                Two nights ago. I didn't call
                the police.

    Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks
    again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like
    he's from Central America stands in the doorway.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                (in Spanish)
                It's all right, son. These are
                friends.

    The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --
    INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

    A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.
    Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,
    various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly
    -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.
    Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER
    TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.
                                FATHER GENARRO
                (referring to the cops)
                These are friends.
                (to Nico)
                This is Father Tomassino.

                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                How do you do?
    Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment
    between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what
    he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father
    Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.
    NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO

    continue down the hall.
                                JACKSON
                I didn't know this church was a
                sanctuary, Father.
                                FATHER GENARRO
                Yes. But, perhaps not such a
                safe one.
                                NICO
                How long have they been here?

                                FATHER GENARRO
                Too long. At least the kids can
                go to our school.

                                NICO
                Who did it, Father?


                                FATHER GENARRO
                Kids, maybe.
                (significantly)
                Maybe worse. It's not the first
                time.
                                JACKSON
                We can have a car check by, every
                hour.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                No... please.    Police frighten
                these people.

    INT. CHURCH - MAIN AISLE - DAY                              
    The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile
    and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is
    greatly relieved.
                                NICO
                Really, I don't mind coming by.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                Tell me, Nico... When was your
                last confession?

                                NICO
                I'm a married man, Father.   I've
                got no sins to confess.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                You're a police officer, you have
                many sins to confess.
                                JACKSON
                Amen.
    Nico and Jackson start off.

                                FATHER GENARRO
                (calls after Nico)
                You come back Sunday. I feel
                better when I see Nicola in
                church.
                (calls louder)
                You don't show, I'm phoning your
                mother!
    DISSOLVE TO:
    SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (SUNDAY)

    HIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people
    dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in
    for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church.

    VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION
    An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the
    churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids,
    babies.

    NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN                                 
    are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends
    and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish.

    INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE
    Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa    
    follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front.

                                ROSA
                Father Genarro! I have you to thank
                for getting my son back into church!

                                FATHER GENARRO
                It's amazing what shame can
                accomplish.

    Father Genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit.

    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
    VARIOUS SHOTS

    A)   THE CHOIR
    building to the finish of a hymn.

    B)   NICO'S WIFE (SARA)                                        
    also singing, balancing baby Julian and a hymnbook.
    C)   NICO AND HIS MOTHER ROSA
    sing with full gusto.

    D)   THE CHOIR MASTER
    makes the sign to be seated.
    E)   CONGREGATION
    sits. We notice a   young, intellectual-looking man
    (Alan Singletary)  wearing wire-rim glasses, sitting in
    the front row. We   will see his face again later. He
    looks out of place  and glances around, surprised as...
    F)   FATHER GENARRO
    moves into the pulpit, opens his Bible.
    
                                FATHER GENARRO
                In nomine patris, filius et
                spiritu sancti... (etc)
    SARA AND JULIAN                                                

    The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico
    reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING.
    Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church.
    He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front
    of the church and turn, heading down one of the side
    aisles.

                                SARA                                  
                (examines Julian's
                diaper)
                Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing.

    She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in
    black pass toward the exit of the church.

    CLOSEUP - WOMAN

    It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with
    Abandano, the lawyer!

    CLOSEUP - LARGE SHOPPING BAG

    The woman has left it in front of the votive candles
    directly before the priest's pulpit.

    CLOSEUP - NICO
    His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway --

    NICO'S POV - DOORWAY

    The woman is hastily sneaking out.
    BACK TO NICO
    Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering
    them with his body.

    CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER
    BOOM!!!    A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest
    and his   congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and
    marble   come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers
    in the   first rows are blown off their feet by the shock
    wave of   the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere --
    CHOIR

    is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain
    down on them from the ceiling.

    CONGREGATION
    is in total pandemonium.   Screams, cries, panic --

    PULPIT
    has been blown to oblivion. Where Father Genarro had
    been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble.

    NICO
    Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping frantically         
    to protect his mother as well.

                                SARA                                  
                (clutching baby)
                We're okay! We're okay!

    Nico checks them and his mother swiftly.

                                ROSA
                (in Italian)
                Help the others! Help them, Nico!

    CUT TO:
    STATUE OF JESUS

    Splattered with real blood.

    CUT BACK TO:
    ANGLE ON CONGREGATION

    Everyone is down, reeling from the concussion, dust and
    smoke. Nico rises alone from this scene.

                                NICO
                (forcefully)
                Help each other move outside.   Be
                calm.
    EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING
    From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth.
    We hear SCREAMS from inside.
    INT. CHURCH
    Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of
    terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past
    him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church-
    goer.
                                NICO
                Call 911. Tell 'em to send
                everything they got!
                (turns to his wife)
                Sara, get the baby and Mama                        
                outside.
    Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.

    EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING
    The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray.
    We see Nico's family -- they're all right.

    NICO
    appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He
    hands the child over to two older women, races back into
    the church.

    LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH
    The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner,
    SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind --

    INT. CHURCH
    Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over
    the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries
    to maintain the priest's life.
    CUT TO:

    INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON

    The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the
    scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty
    of pain and misery.

    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
    Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look
    on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the
    plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro.
    A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father.
    JACKSON
    arrives.   Nico talks to her, aside.
                                NICO
                I want a list of everyone that's
                been treated here today. Everyone.
                                JACKSON
                Right.
                                NICO
                Then find those sanctuary people,
                the ones we saw in the church
                basement --
    As Jackson makes notes.

                                NICO
                Find out where they're from, why
                anyone would want to harm them.

    Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go.
                                JACKSON
                Where are you gonna be?

                                NICO
                Just stay near a radio.   I'll find
                you.

    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON

    Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara             
    and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside
    his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's
    arm, helps her to her feet.

    Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro     
    has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of
    the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with
    his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly,
    Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who    
    ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   
    and two uniformed officers.

                                NICO
                Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    
                be with you in a minute.
    He hails Neeley.                                              

                                NICO
                I need to talk to you.
                (a glance to Strozah
                and others)
                ... Alone.
    Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       
    fire exit door --
    STAIRWELL LANDING
    The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are
    alone on the stairway landing.
                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                (impatient)
                What the hell is it, Toscani?
    Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      
    him furiously into the wall!
                                NICO
                You.   That's what the hell it is!
                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                Get your goddam hands off me!
    Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.               

                                NICO
                You let Salvano walk.
                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                Salvano?! Are you crazy?
                (rips himself free)
                What does he have to do with this?
                                NICO
                That was no cherry bomb in there.
                That was C-fucking-4!
                (struggles to master
                his rage)
                I've used that shit.
                I know what it smells like, I know
                what it blows like --

    glares at Nico.                                    
                                AGENT NEELEY                       
                Salvano never came near that C-4.
                It's in federal holding now!
                Besides, why would he blow up a
                church?
                                NICO
                I tailed Salvano. Two days ago.
                Him and one of his apes were in
                that church -- and they weren't
                taking communion. I saw some broad
                saw who was with his lawyer plant
                the bomb. Now I want some goddamn
                answers.
                                AGENT NEELEY                       
                You tailed him? After I ordered
                you off?
                                NICO
                Where is he?    Where's Salvano?
                                AGENT NEELEY                       
                My orders were release him.    Not
                babysit him.
    brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels.         
                                AGENT NEELEY                       
                You think you're rough stuff,
                Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop
                suey crap. Well I'll tell you
                something: you're not bullet-
                proof. You're not even a good
                cop.
                (composes himself;
                reclaims his dignity)
                You sneak around, playing your
                street dick games. But all you
                come up with is conjecture, wild
                coincidence and bullshit.

                                NICO
                I want the agent who signed for

                I'll do my job. You do yours.
                                NICO
                Bank on it, pal.

    Nico stalks off.   The door slams.
    CUT TO:

    MONTAGE WITH SCORE
    A)   EXT. "BOGOTA" (SALVANO'S RESTAURANT) - LATE AFTERNOON      

    Nico's unmarked car whips in front.   Nico storms toward
    the front door of the restaurant.
    B)   INT. RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON                           

    Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The
    employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He
    flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's
    office.   The man is gone.

    C)   INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON
    Jackson has her list from the hospital.    A coroner and
    his assitant show her a body on a slab.    The body is
    that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw   in the front     
    row of the church. Jackson takes notes.     The dead man   
    is definitely not the ethnic type you'd   expect in St.
    Mary's congregation.
    D)   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON
    The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi
    Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers.
    All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano
    not here.
    E)   CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON

    takes Polaroids of the dead man's I.D. and personal
    effects.

    CLOSEUP OF DEAD MAN'S EFFECTS
    as Jackson's flash pops. We see clearly a U.S. Senate
    staff ID, a U.S. Senate office building parking pass and
    an Illinois driver's license with address.
    EXT. AFFLUENT BROWNSTONE - LATE AFTERNOON

    Nico comes storming out. A Maid and a bodyguard follow
    after him screaming. The door slams. We see it is
    missing a panel.
                                MAID
                You gonna be in real trouble,
                mister, when El Senor Salvano
                find out about dis.

    EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
    Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area
    off while a TV news crew photographs the damage. Jackson       
    talks with neighborhood people, asking questions.
    EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

    Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be-
    fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero;
    Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out
    the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls
    in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-
    rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward
    his car --
                                FIRST LATINO
                (polite, casual)
                'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
    Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously. As he reaches to
    his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open. A
    .38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head. Instantly three
    other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk.
                                FIRST LATINO
                (machete under jacket)
                Don't even think about it,
                motherfucker.
    Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its
    shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the
    alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of
    them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
                                MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO)
                You come to our streets... fuck
                with our people. Now our people
                gonna fuck with you.

    The five advance on Nico.
                                PIPE MAN
                We ain't gonna shoot you, man.
                We gonna beat you to death. You
                gonna learn what it means to 'get
                down.'

    QUICK CUTS
    A)   Nico is  trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a
    moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking
    out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-
    ness.   Then:


    B)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man
    starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his
    wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,
    keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun
    Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,
    slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing
    the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his
    wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain
    link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man
    (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-
    ing, half-unconscious.
    C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's
    head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of
    the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,
    blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing
    Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes
    down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in
    pain.
    D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,
    flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-
    ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the
    van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with
    just his head and shoulders dangling free.

    E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar
    Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,
    and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-
    tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one
    knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,
    machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and
    whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of
    Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-
    mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at
    his own groin.
    F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-
    perately to regain his senses. He tries to get
    Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-
    way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,
    bolts.

    G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to
    Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van
    window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the
    head, then tears off after Machete Man --

    EXT. STREET - DAY
    Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,
    straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he
    vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He
    too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --
    ANGLE DOWN BLOCK

    An all-out foot face.


    Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.
    TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.

                                FIRST GIRL
                Fly, baby!
    NICO

    tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's
    gaining --
    INT. BODEGA - DAY

    Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a
    Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the
    hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes
    Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --

    EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY
    Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with
    tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,
    which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone
    inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --
    BACK TO NICCO
    pursuing along the same route.
    MACHETE MAN

    claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-
    work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-
    bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked
    between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,
    starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.
    Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto
    the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as
    the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.
    Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-
    jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by
    the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-
    fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --

    BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY
    Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with
    terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man
    scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner
    next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move
    either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The
    girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.

                                MACHETE MAN
                (to Nico, in terror)
                No, hermano. Please --


    starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard
    the chase.

                                NICO
                Who put up the money?
                                MACHETE MAN
                What money?

    grabs him by the hair.
                                NICO
                You didn't come after me for a
                piece of ass.
                (twists the youth's
                neck)
                Who paid you?

                                MACHETE MAN
                I told ya!    No one!
    slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood
    over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even
    Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
                                NICO
                (shouting)
                Shut up!
    girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back
    Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking
    punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see
    Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
                                NICO
                Give it to me!
    raises his fist to strike.

                                MACHETE MAN
                Jimmy Constanza!
    shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's
    from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-
    seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He
    the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete
    is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.

                                NICO
                If you're lying to me, I'll come
                and kill you right in your own
                fucking kitchen.

    dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly
    Man changes his tune.
                                MACHETE MAN
                Salvano!   Bautista Salvano!

    Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
    He hits the ground with a thud.

                                NICO
                Gracias, muchacho.
    Nico walks away.

    MONTAGE WITH SCORE

    Nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads, old add-

    containing a phrase. We read: "Father G had some-
    thing on Salvano?" "Church break-in?" "Drug infor-
    mation?" "Father G connected to FBI?" Irritably,
    Nico's pencil crosses everything out.

    SARA

                I can't sleep. Will you come and
                hold me?

                                NICO
                Of course I will. I've been waiting
                to hear from Jax. She was supposed
                to get back to me by now.

    INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
    Nico comes in with his arms around Sara. She stops
    near the bed, holds him tight. They look to little
    Julian sleeping in the crib nearby.
                                SARA
                Thank God you couldn't find your
                shoes. We would of have been
                sitting in the front row.
                (beat)
                Alright, I know the rules -- I
                don't ask you don't tell. But
                could've died today and I deserve
                to know.
                (beat)
                Why did we go to church this
                morning?
                                NICO
                I'm willing to break   the rules;
                I'm willing to tell   you whatever
                I know. But I need    some time.
                Could you just give   me some time?
    Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING
    of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico
    glance at each other --
                                SARA
                I'll bet that's her.
    Nico picks up the phone.

                                NICO
                (into phone)
                This better be good, Jax.

                (filtered)
                It's bad, Nico.

    Nico glances to Sara. The voice on the   phone is not
    Jackson. Nico is chilled. He glances    to Sara, finger to
    his lips. He points to his bare wrist   as if wanting to know
    the exact time. Sara, not sure what's   going on, mouths:
    "Two-fifteen."

                                NICO
                (into phone)
                Long time, Nelson.

    EXT. STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHT
    We recognize Fox, Nico's buddy  from SE Asia whom we met
    in the opening sequence.  Fox,  too, of course, looks 15
    years older. He wears a  suit  and seems quite prosperous.
    We are unable to identify from  where Fox calls.
                                FOX
                You should know not to use a name
                on an open line.
                (beat)
                I'm gonna talk for fifteen
                seconds, then I'm getting off.
                You're in trouble, Nico.
    BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

                (filtered)
                Serious, serious trouble. Take
                your wife and family and get them
                someplace safe now.
    BACK TO STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHT
                                FOX
                You hear me? Now. I'm risking my
                ass by telling you this. Good
                luck, kid.
    BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
    The PHONE CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex-
    pression. Sara sees through it -- she knows he's shaken.     
                                SARA                                 
                (grim)
                That was Fox, wasn't it?

    Nico doesn't answer.
                                SARA                                 
                (very concerned)
                Why is the C.I.A. calling you at
                two in the morning?
                                NICO
                It's okay, sweetheart --
                (crosses to her, puts
                his arms around her)
                -- You know what a crazy bastard
                Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets
                he's halfway around the world. He
                calls me.
    Nico gives her a squeeze and a smile.

                                NICO
                He just wanted to make sure we got
                his Christmas card.

    INT. BEDROOM - LATER
    Sara is sleeping next to Nico. Julian next to her. A         
    LOUD POUNDING comes O.S. from the front door. Nico jumps
    out of bed. His gun appears in his hand, as if from nowhere,
    he steps quickly to the front window, looks out --
    NICO'S POV - STREET BELOW

    Two unmarked cars pull in.
    BACK TO NICO

    He moves swiftly to the rear window and spots another un-      
    marked car.                                                    
    INT. DOWNSTAIRS - FRONT DOOR
    Nico enters the vestibule in his pajama bottoms with his gun
    in his hand.
                                VOICE THROUGH DOOR (O.S.)
                F.B.I., Toscani. Open up.
    Nico pulls aside a curtained glass panel; he recognizes
    two uniformed police officers, plus Neeley and Halloran,       
    the FBI agents who authorized the release of Salvano. He
    lowers his gun, opens the door. The cops surge in.
                                NICO
                (to one of cops)
                It's a little early for breakfast,
                O'Hara.
                                O'HARA
                Sorry, Nico.
                (displays warrant)
                You're under arrest.

                                AGENT NEELEY                           
                (reaches for Nico's
                gun)
                I'll take this, thank you.

    Before Neeley can get his hand on the gun, Nico, without       
    pausing, hands it over to another agent.
                                NICO
                No, you won't. I'm gonna give it
                to you.

    INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    JULIAN BAWLS fearfully; Sara holds him, trembling. Nico         
    is hurriedly getting dressed. A cop and the FBI agents
    stand at the door.
                                SARA                                    
                (to cops; distraught)
                This is ridiculous -- there's
                no need for this!
                                NICO
                It's all right, darling.

    Two agents enter the room carrying Nico's confiscated
    papers and tapes and begin rummaging through dressers,
    jewelry boxes and closets. Rosa crosses swiftly to calm
    Sara.                                                           

                                ROSA
                (to cops)
                Who do you think you are --
                coming in here like this,
                treating my son like a criminal?
                                SARA                                    
                Why are you terrifying us?
                There's an infant here!
    Nico pulls on a jacket. He looks like he could kill.    He
    restrains himself for his family's sake.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                (to cops)
                Check that coat.

    The cops cross to frisk Nico.   Sara, still holding the baby,   
    starts slapping at them.

                                SARA                                    
                Get your hands off him!
    Rosa grabs Sara --                                              

                                NICO
                (to Sara,                                      
                allowing himself
                to be frisked)
                It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      
                gonna be all right.
    The cops steer Nico toward the door.

                                SARA                                    
                (calls after them)
                The Police Association's got lawyers
                for this, you bastards!

    Sara grabs for the phone; Nico is manhandled out the            
    door --

    EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

    The neighbors are now on their porches.   Nico is led to a
    waiting unmarked car.

    CUT TO:

    INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - LATE NIGHT
    Bad Dude, the bartender we remember from Nico's first
    visit to the Polish bar, finishes signing a deposition.
    A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands, glances half-
    fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall-
    way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran
    opens the door for Bad Dude, who exits.

    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATE NIGHT
    Neeley, Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten-     
    dent JACK CROWDER. Halloran indicates a stack of                
    depositions, tapes and notes on the table before Nico.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized
                surveillance.

                                AGENT NEELEY                             
                Associating with known felons.
                Disobeying direct orders --

                                NICO
                Where's Jackson?

                                CROWDER                                  
                She's outa this.
                                AGENT HALLORAN
                You're the rotten apple in this
                barrel, Toscani. We don't have
                to look any farther than you and
                your 'family.'

    Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran.      Strozah
    tries to block him, but it's useless.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH                       
                Nico! You damn fool! You wanna
                go to prison?!
    Nico stops. He's speechless with rage.    His finger points
    toward Halloran like a loaded gun.

                                CROWDER                               
                (indicates more
                depositions)
                Unlawful entry. Illegal search
                and seizure --
                                NICO
                (spits on papers)
                You'll never build a frame on this
                chickenshit.
                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                (angrily)
                You were ordered to back off on
                Salvano. But you had too big a
                hard-on for that, didn't you--

    Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with
    a gesture that says "I won't hurt you."
                                NICO
                (to Strozah)
                Fred.   You can't be in on this.
    Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       
    years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's
    a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com-
    pletely understand.
                                LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    
                You're officially suspended, Toscani.
                I want your tin... and your iron.
    Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   
    tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who
    averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table.
                                NICO
                You holding me?

                                AGENT NEELEY                          
                You can walk for now. But don't
                walk far.

    CUT TO:
    EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON DOWNTOWN STREET - DAWN

    We are outside of a cop breakfast hangout. Several police
    cars are parked in the lot. Nico is on the phone.

    turns to Lukich, dead earnest.

                                NICO
                Luke. I  want you to go to my
                house.  Call Branca... my mother
                has the number. Get my family
                ready to move out.
                                LUKICH
                You got it, buddy.

                                NICO
                Stay with 'em. We'll be there.
                                LUKICH
                What's going on, Nico?   What
                happened?
                                NICO
                I got a call last night. An old
                agency friend. He told me my
                family was in danger.
    Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.    But
    if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy.
                                LUKICH
                You got a weapon?
    Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the
    street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the
    driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map
    pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45.
                                LUKICH
                Try this on.
    Jackson watches Luke slip Nico a clip.                         
    CUT TO:

    INT. DAY CARE CENTER (BEHIND CHURCH) - MORNING
    OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees.
    They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind
    of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been
    burned and family members murdered. The refugees have
    been moved from church basement to a back room in the day
    care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the
    background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom
    we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people.
    Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear.
                                NICO
                (to nun)
                Sister... you know me. Tell them
                there's no need for fear.


                                SISTER BONIFACIA
                There is rubble all over the yard,
                Nicola.

    REST OF THE SCENE MAY BE IN ENGLISH, OR SPANISH WITH
    AT THE DIRECTOR'S DISCRETION.)
                                NICO
                (to refugees)
                I was there... in the church.
                They tried to kill my family, too.
    of the refugees look like they want to speak, but
    are terrified.
                                NICO
                I know there was a man here, from
                an American senator's office. Who
                was he going to speak to?
    refugees become increasingly anxious.
                                NICO
                (to one woman)
                Was it you, senora?
                (to a man)
                Was it you?
    silence.    Glances among the people.   Finally:
                                REFUGEE WOMAN
                The priest.
    others shrink.   The Woman glances to them.
                                NICO
                Who?
                (gently)
                Father Genarro?

                                REFUGEE WOMAN
                The other one.

    looks to the American priest standing there.
                                REFUGEE WOMAN
                No. The young one. From Costa
                Rica.

    Bonifacia sighs.
                                SISTER BONIFACIA
                Father Tomassino.

    has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows
    much has already been revealed; she must speak.


                                SISTER BONIFACIA
                He came alone... two weeks ago.
                He had papers. Papers to give to
                the senator.

    Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by
    losing his calm.

                                NICO
                But the bomb... The bomb was
                planted to destroy the pulpit.
                                SISTER BONIFACIA
                Father Tomassino was going to
                give the Mass that day.
                (shaken)
                Father Genarro talked him out of
                it.

    The refugees' faces confirm this.
                                NICO
                (understands)
                It was Father Tomassino they were
                trying to kill.

    Bonifacia starts softly to cry.    Nico puts his hand on her
    shoulder, comforting her.
                                NICO
                Where is Tomassino?   Where is he
                now?
    The nun shakes her head.   Nico looks to the refugees.
    They don't know, either.

                                REFUGEE MAN
                He run, mister. He go --

    He gestures: "who knows where?"
                                NICO
                If you know where he is, you've
                got to tell me. I want to help
                him. I can help him.
    The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her
    soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says
    "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico
    stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder --
    EXT. CHURCH DAY CARE BUILDING - DAY

    Nico and Jackson come out.   Nico has made a decision.
                                NICO
                You're outa this, Jax.    Go home.

                                JACKSON
                (displays her notes)
                You see this list? Well, I'm not
                done.

    Nico admires his partner's guts, but he's worried.
                                JACKSON
                I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now,
                go home. Get your family out of
                here.
    Nico agrees.    The pair starts to split.

                                NICO
                (calls after
                Jackson)
                Just paperwork, you understand?

    CUT TO:
    INT. NICO'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING
    Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.      Urgency
    fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought --

    EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING
    Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around
    without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart       
    while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street.      
    ANOTHER CAR
    ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH-
    ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring
    open --
    NICO

    dives toward his own passenger door --
    SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN

    leap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons.
    QUICK CUTS

    Nico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE.      WINDOWS
    BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded --

    NICO - ON FLOORBOARD
    crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as
    a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around
    him.
    FOUR MEN

    FIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car.   The
    men are cool, professional.
    NICO

    spills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles
    like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars.
    PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION

    scream and scatter in terror.
    FOUR MEN
    FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their
    weapons.
    NICO'S CAR
    being chewed to pieces --
    NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR                                          

    crawling at full speed from the car's front to its back.
    On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES
    RAIN like hailstones.
    FOUR MEN
    As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free,
    GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader
    waves two men forward to check their kill. At that
    instant:
    NICO

    springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45            
    clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars
    to envelop his attackers.)

                                NICO
                Over here, you sons-a-bitches!
    Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster-
    nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into
    his weapon --

                                NICO
                (eyes like an
                animal)
                Try it. Be my guest.

    The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The
    others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
    to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
    gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a
    corner grocery store. A phone inside.
                                NICO
                (gestures with gun)
                Over there! Move it! -- Now!!
    The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in
    back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --

    INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY
    A Pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter-
    ing his store and bolts for the rear. A customer exits
    as Nico herds his captives in.
                                NICO
                Hands on the counter!
    Three men do it; the fourth is slow.
                                NICO
                Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE --
    The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the
    wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         
    ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes
    his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men
    sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his
    eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again
    to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles
    toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men
    has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a
    second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering
    into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet.
    One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the
    freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The
    GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's
    three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into
    his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails
    into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land
    a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered
    forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

    POV FROM OUTSIDE STORE

    It looks like a tornado has hit the interior. Magazine
    RACKS CRASH, mayo jars fly through the air, the ICE
    MACHINE seems to EXPLODE as a man's back careens into it --

    STREET CORNER UP BLOCK
    Two police cars heave into view, SIRENS WAILING --

    FRONT DOORS OF STORE
    Nico takes the last man, lifts him up, and drives him like
    a battering ram straight through the glass.

    NICO
    Wild-eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars whipping into the
    corner. He spins to see his .45 on the floor -- too far
    away to race for. He bolts down a gangway.

    INT. NICO'S BEDROOM - DAY

    Sara grabs a handful of dresses from the closet and angrily      
    throws them into an open suitcase on the bed. Nico watches,
    hoping to ride the storm.

                                SARA                                    
                Your job and your family in one day,

    Sara is at the dresser, pulling open drawers, dumping her      
    clothes haphazardly into the suitcase. She stops suddenly.
    She pulls out a handgun and ammo from her panty drawer. She
    starts to weep. Nico steps up behind her, puts his arms
    around her.

                                NICO
                You'll be safe with Uncle Branca.
                It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.

    He turns her around to face him.

                There was a second priest... from
                Costa Rica... hiding at the church.
                He was the one they meant to kill.
    Nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the
    basement heater.
                                LUKICH
                And you know where to find him?

                No.

    The hole in the foundation holds several shotguns and a

                You're gonna need help.
    Nico grabs the pistols, starts to strap them on.

    As he finishes viewing the screen, stands.

                                NICO
                Five agents   from Central American desk.
                All trained   assassins. All arrived in
                Chicago in   the last week -- and none
                of them has   left.
    Nico grabs his coat, gulps a last swallow of coffee --

                                NICO
                Thanks, Wat. You finally may have
                done some good for your country.

    CUT TO:
    EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

    Jackson's unmarked car whips into the curb. Aboard:          
    Jackson and Lukich. Nico steps from the shadows, ducks
    into the back seat. The car takes off.

    INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

                The nun phoned me. She said two men
                had been sneaking around the church.
                She sounded scared --

    Nico checks his .45.    Two spare clips.


                                JACKSON
                There's more. I got the papers
                from that senator's aide's apartment.
                Everything Harrison's been working on.
                It's all at my place.

    ELEVATED SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

    BOOMS PAST CAMERA, only a few feet away from a row of
    tenement apartment buildings. As TRAIN sound RECEDES,
    CAMERA MOVES IN ON one building. We hear LOUD UPBEAT
    ROCK AND ROLL coming from a third-floor apartment --
    EXT. TENEMENT - POV FROM CAR ON STREET - NIGHT

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                (from within car)
                Once you're inside, you'll signal us.
    INT. CAR - CLOSEUP ON TREMBLING WOMAN (SAME STREET)
    It is the Middle-aged Woman who left the bomb, seen in Father
    Genarro's church. A police sketch of her was seen on tele-
    vision. She is looking up at the third-floor window, getting
    instructions. She turns around occasionally to see who's
    talking to her.
                                SALVANO (O.S.)
                Don't be scared. Your life depends on
                this.
    CLOSE ON DRIVER
    It is one of Salvano's goons we've seen before.    He is
    checking his gun.
    INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

    The Woman walks slowly down the hall. She carries a small
    donation can. She knocks on a door. We hear FOOTSTEPS from
    within the apartment. The door opens. It's Bonifacia, the
    nun from the church (though now in civvies). The Middle-Aged
    Woman with the donation can raises it as if asking for a
    contribution. Bonificia looks flustered, impatient. She
    really doesn't want to leave the door open.

                                MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                Exusame, por favor. Tiene dinero
                para...

    FROM NOWHERE

    Three of Salvano's armed goons appear on both sides of the
    doorway. They push both women violently into the apartment.


    CLOSEUP - GOON
    He steps quickly, surely into the apartment.

    CLOSEUP - BEDROOM DOOR
    It flies open.   The goon points his gun AT the CAMERA.

    GUNMEN'S POV

    Father Tomassino, the Costa Rican priest, stands at the
    window, he has been trying to open it. He turns. He knows
    he can't escape.

    EXT. APARTMENT - POV FROM SALVANO'S CAR
    The light in the apartment window blinks twice.

    EXT. TENEMENT - STREET - NIGHT
    From two cars emerge the shapes of several men.
    EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT
    Jackson's car -- with Jackson, Nico and Lukich aboard --
    swings around a corner into a traffic jam. The HORN BLARES.
    INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT
    A STEREO SPEAKER BLASTS MUSIC from the front room. CAMERA
    PANS ACROSS Bonifacia's bedroom dresser. We see mementos
    of her life and a photo of herself with Father Genarro with
    a group of children. CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN PAST Bonifacia's
    bed, PAST Bonifacia's body! CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN TO the
    floor, where lies the lady who planted the bomb. They both
    appear dead.
    CLOSE - FATHER TOMASSINO

    He is in a chair, his wrists strapped to the chair arms.    He
    is sweating, fearful but clinging to his courage.
    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Behind Father Tomassino, we see Salvano, Chi Chi and two
    other goons, armed with pistols. Salvano moves toward the
    priest, sets a small TV table down beside him. The priest
    glances toward it --

    PRIEST'S POV - TV TABLE
    Atop its rickety surface:   a fearsome array of syringes and
    drug vials.

    BACK TO FATHER TOMASSINO
    He glances up from the hypodermics --

    PRIEST'S POV
    INTO FRAME moves Kurt Zagon! We see clearly the 15 years of   
    aging since SE Asia. His face is even scarier than when he
    performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon prepares
    a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward.
                                ZAGON
                You'll be in heaven in a few minutes,
                padre. But first I'm going to put
                you through hell.
    EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

    Nico, Lukich and Jackson are speeding through the infamous
    Southside. We want to scream at them to get there already.

    BACK TO APARTMENT

    Salvano holds the priest's arm steady, Zagon moves in with
    the needle.
                                ZAGON
                You came here to talk to the                        
                Senator's aide, didn't you?                         

                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                I tried.   But you killed him first.                
                                ZAGON
                Who told you about our plans?                       
                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                This is from confession. I tell no
                one.

                                ZAGON
                You wouldn't lie to me, Father?   It's
                a sin.

    Father Tomassino says nothing, he begins to cry.
                                ZAGON
                (almost with kindness)
                If you spoke to anyone, tell me now --
                (indicates hypo)
                -- and I won't have to use this.

    EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT
    The unmarked police car pulls up, across the street.

    INT. CAR - NIGHT

    Nico, Jackson, and Lukich gaze at the building.

    POV FROM CAR                                                   
    In the shadows by the corner, a hulking Latino man loiters.    

                                JACKSON (O.S.)                         
                That's an eyeball if I ever saw one.                 
    BACK TO CAR                                                    

    Nico starts to open the car door.   Jackson moves to join him. 
                                NICO
                You're our backup. If we come out
                running, then you can shoot.
    Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her
    leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson
    accepts this reluctantly.


    EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT
    Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent
    building; he and Lukich start for it.

    INT. APARTMENT
    Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of
    Zagon's chemicals. In spite of this the priest's spirit to
    resist is astounding...
                                ZAGON
                Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?

                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                I know what you are. I know what
                beasts you are.

    EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ROOF OF TENEMENT
    Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The
    roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair
    creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the
    roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover
    to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that
    leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of
    the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door
    open --
    STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH

    Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof.    Nico
    opens the door leading to the top (third) floor.
    INT. APARTMENT

    The drugs have taken hold. The priest's brain is an open
    memory bank for Zagon to probe.

                                ZAGON
                I want to know who you told.
                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                (barely coherent)
                I told them... you make the ninos...
                see... castrating their fathers --
                raping... mutilating their mothers
                ... And...
                (breaks down crying)
                ... and sometimes... to the ninos...
    NICO'S POV - HALLWAY

    As he slowly pushes the door open.   The hallway is empty.
    INT. HALLWAY

    Nico and Lukich pad in.

    Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down. Nico crosses
    silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of
    the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door.
    Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up
    positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC
    CONTINUES from inside.
    INSIDE APARTMENT

    Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening
    to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.
                                ZAGON (O.S.)
                -- Tell me the truth, Father --
    The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat
    beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies
    of some narcotic hell.

                                ZAGON
                (close to priest)
                -- Can we kill him? If you told anyone,
                about our plans to kill the senator,
                we cannot do it.
                                FATHER TOMASSINO
                Nadie.   Nadie. Nadie.                             
    NICO AND LUKICH IN HALLWAY
    O.S. we hear another ELEVATED TRAIN APPROACHING outside.
    Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in,
    guns clutched two-handed.
    QUICK CUTS

    The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him.
    Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed-
    off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to
    dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE-
    BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan-
    taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the
    priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the
    shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs
    Lukich, dives out the door with him --
    HALLWAY

    Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt.
    BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER
    everywhere. Nico shoves Lukich toward the stairwell --

                                NICO
                Go!   Go!
    -- Simultaneously FIRING back through the kicked-in door,
    EMPTYING his GUN.

                                ZAGON
                (in Spanish, from
                apartment)
                Get him! Finish him!

    Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away
    toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the
    apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at
    Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam
    into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs!
    Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches
    Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll,
    down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony,     
    twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls
    the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through
    the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench-
    man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi
    Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the
    ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
                                ZAGON
                Now!
    Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new
    clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway,
    SHOOTING at Nico.
    INTERCUT - ELEVATED TRAIN
    THUNDERING along the tracks adjacent to the building.

    EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
    Nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts
    all around him with GUNFIRE from the floor below! He dives
    sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his
    footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof
    from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate,
    taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico
    is trapped -- in the open.
    ZAGON AND SALVANO

    pop back out, aiming at Nico --
    NICO

    leaps off the roof!

    ANGLE - ELEVATED TRAIN - MOVING
    Nico lands on the roof of the speeding "el" train, his
    momentum nearly carrying him off the far side --

    NICO - ATOP TRAIN
    catches a railing, claws at it.   BULLETS rip into the train
    roof all around him --

    ATOP TENEMENT ROOF - SALVANO AND ZAGON
    FIRE for all they're worth at Nico's receding form.

    ATOP TRAIN - NICO
    crawls to the space between cars, lowers himself down.      He
    clings to the swaying chains.

    INT. TRAIN CAR
    Nico staggers through the almost empty car and collapses on
    a bench.

    AROUND CORNER - TWO POLICE CARS
    hurtle INTO VIEW under the El, SIRENS BLARING.                   

    BACK ON TENEMENT ROOF
    Zagon and Salvano scramble away.
    OMITTED
    CUT TO:

    EXT. EL STATION - STAIRWAY TO STREET - NIGHT
    A cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the
    steps, clutching his jacket to his ribs. Several affluent
    people look at him oddly, he ignores them, keeps going -- He
    makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown-
    stone. Nico climbs the steps in pain --
    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

    INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
    Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a
    makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs. We see Jackson's make-
    up stuff along the counter, feminine robes hanging on the
    door, law books around a reading stand. Nico is in real
    pain, exhausted, weakening --

    LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
    Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes
    and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We
    glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities, dead
    bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his
    attention shifts --

    Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's
    degree on the wall, her rowing machine on the floor, several
    framed photos beside him on her desk. Nico turns several
    toward him.

    INSERT - FRAMED PHOTOS
    Jackson with her sisters and their kids, Jackson in law
    class, Jackson and Nico posing, smiling, at the police shoot-
    ing range --

    He starts to cry.

                -- Had to be a hero... another fucking
                hero. I'm sorry Jax.
    He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it.

    CLOSEUP - CALENDAR

    Nico circles "meet with Father Tomassino." Nico circles
    another date, "Senator delivers foreign policy position
    paper/Committee for Democratic Policy fund raiser."             
    
    BACK TO NICO
    Nico scoops up the aide's papers, stands, wobbly --

                -- Senator... --
                (of papers, with scorn)

                let you put 'em outta business --
    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

    Several cops frantically clear the way to the emergency room.
    A gurney is wheeled down the corridor. Lukich, a shoulder
    bandaged, walks beside the gurney, holding the hand of Jackson.

    CLOSEUP ON
    a bloody flak jacket rests upon the gurney.

    CLOSEUP - JACKSON

    She's been sedated. She has buckshot wounds on her neck and
    shoulder, but she is alive.

                                JACKSON
                (to Lukich)
                You call Nico's goddamn Uncle and
                find out if he's heard anything.

                                LUKICH
                (wounded himself)
                You just shutup and take it easy,

    INT. TAXI - NIGHT
    CLOSEUP of Nico riding through the wet streets.

    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM
    Lukich is on the phone. His shirt is off and he's being

    INT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
    Branca, a bodyguard next to him, grimly puts down the phone.
    He looks devastated.

    EXT. DRIVEWAY - BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
    From the darkness, Nico appears, barely making it up the
    driveway. We hear the sound of the CAB DRIVE OFF.

    EXT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
    Branca and a bodyguard come forward, grabbing Nico as Nico
    almost collapses.

                                BRANCA

                She's gonna make it. She was
                wearing a vest.
    Nico can't believe it. In spite of it all, life comes to
    him. A little smile...

    room window. She witnesses the arrival of the doctor. On
    the bed behind her sleep Sara and Julian. A bodyguard          
    stands outside the bedroom door.
    INT. BASEMENT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

    The doctor tends Nico. Bloody bandages and antiseptic
    bottles litter a coffee table. Two guards stand by. Branca
    is showing Nico an 8-by-11 photograph.

                                BRANCA
                It was picked up with your mail this
                afternoon.

    INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

    A shot of Nico's family taken from a parked car, in front of
    the church, the morning of the bombing.

    BACK TO NICO AND BRANCA
    Nico's grim expression shows he knows just what this means.

                                BRANCA
                Don't worry, they're booked on an early
                plane. They'll be out of the country
                tomorrow.

    Nico winces as the doctor finishes applying a bandage.      In
    the background we hear a COMMOTION.
    INT. BASEMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

    A bodyguard tries to fend off the physical and verbal assault
    from Sara and Rosa. Sara carries Julian.                      

    INT. BASEMENT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

    Sara rushes to Nico's side.    Nico reaches for her, but         
    the pain stabs him.
                                SARA                                     
                Oh my God, Nico!                                       
    Rosa starts forward, her face in agony at the sight of her
    wounded son.
                                BRANCA
                He's fine.   The boy has ribs of steel!

                                ROSA
                (touching Nico's brow)
                Enough of your humor.
    Sara clings to Nico's arm, tears in her eyes. Rosa               
    crosses herself. Sara begins to weep. The doctor finishes.       
    There's a long awkward moment. Then:

                                BRANCA
                (to doctor and
                bodyguards)
                Leave them. Leave them alone.

    QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
    INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER

    Rosa sits in a chair. Nico on the couch, holding Julian.
    Sara faces him. Tears have stained her cheeks, but she           
    is in control of her emotions now.                               

                                SARA
                -- You've got to do it, Nico.    You
                know you have to.
    Whatever Sara is proposing, Nico is dead set against it.


                                ROSA
                Listen to her, Nicola.
                (dead serious)
                Whatever you think of him, Federico
                is family. He is our family.
    makes no response.   Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles
    tenderly.

                                NICO
                Ever notice how clean babies smell?
                Like nothing in the world has touched
                them yet.

    glances to Rosa. Rosa knows what she wants. Dis-
    Rosa rises, exits. Sara and Nico are alone.

                                SARA
                If you won't go to him, I will.
                                NICO
                (in pain)
                Don't push me like this --
    eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate.

                                SARA
                Branca can put us on a plane -- but
                where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon?
                There's nowhere they can't find us.

                                NICO
                You don't know what the hell you're
                talking about.
                                SARA
                I'm talking about everything I've
                learned from you in the past five
                years.

    is in agony.
                                NICO
                You know I can't go to him.
    takes both his hands in hers.

                                SARA
                Do you know why I love you? Do
                you know what it is about you
                that I've always loved?
                (as Nico fights his
                own emotion)
                Pride. It's what you have inside.
                You don't live the way other people
                live. You trust what you see as
                right and won't let anyone or anything
                make you stray from it.

    MOVE IN PAST Sara TO Nico's face.
                                SARA (O.S.)
                But now that pride may kill all
                of us.
                (beat)
                You've got to swallow that pride,
                Nico. Choke on it if you have to.
                Lay it aside.

    ANOTHER ANGLE - NICO AND SARA
    Close together, with their baby between them. Sara
    buries her face against her husband's chest. Nico's arm
    goes around her. He holds her tight.

                You can come now, Mr. Carlucci.
    O.S. we hear a METALLIC sound BEGIN, VERY CLOSE -- PULL
    BACK TO:

    ANOTHER ANGLE
    To reveal bars which slide electrically to the side.    A
    prison door opens, letting him through.

    ANGLE - PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY
    Nico, escorted by a prison guard, walks down a long, blank
    hallway.
    CUT TO:

    NICO
    Waiting in a barren reception room.   Several benches, tables;
    heavy steel mesh over windows --

    NICO'S POV - ACROSS ROOM
    A steel door opens on the far side. Out steps a small
    Italian man in his seventies, wearing the faded denim of
    an inmate.

    INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - LONG SHOT - DAY                          
    Nico and the small man (FREDERICO LARUSSO) walk together down 
    a long corridor, speaking occasionally, the tension thick     
    between them. Behind them, a discreet fifteen paces, walk     
    two armed prison officials.
    CLOSER - LARUSSO AND NICO

    The old man never looks directly at Nico, yet we sense keenly
    that he is taking the younger man's measure.
                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                I am only an old man. An old man
                with a cancer.
    The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each
    other -- using all five senses and more.

                                NICO
                I don't have much time, Uncle.    So
                I must speak plainly.
    Larusso listens.   Nico waits for a beat.   Then:

                                NICO
                (this is very painful
                for him)
                -- For as long as I've been old enough
                to think, I've hated you and hated
                everything you stood for.
    Larusso takes this in without a flicker.

                                NICO
                I was so sure that you and I were on
                opposite sides of the fence... and
                that you and your people were
                destroying this country --
    Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds.

                                NICO
                -- The most painful realization of my
                life was that the people I worked for
                and you are not far apart.
                (meets Larusso's eyes)
                -- And there's not much difference
                between what you are and what I was.
    Larusso studies Nico a long moment.    Then takes Nico's elbow.

    NICO AND LARUSSO

    continue across the grounds.
                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                I will be    candid with you. I knew,
                probably    before you did, that you
                would be    coming to me. I knew what
                you would    ask... and I had every
                intention    of refusing you.

    He glances to Nico.
                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                But it is a form of wisdom to know
                when to cease relying only upon
                yourself.

    He keeps walking.

                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                You know, of course, that this Senator
                Harrison will never live to make his
                speech tomorrow.
                (as Nico acknowledges)
                You know, too, that as long as this
                man... this torturer --

                                NICO
                Kurt Zagon.

                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                -- As long as this Zagon lives, nothing
                I can do will guarantee your family's
                safety.
                (beat)

                (translates)
                'These are not men, these are animals.'

    Larusso stops, takes a small note pad from his pocket.         He
    quickly scribbles a few lines.
                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                Memorize this address.

    He holds the paper for Nico to see.
                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                Have you got it in your mind?
    Nico nods.    Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.             

    INT. ADMIN BUILDING - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
    The old man takes his leave of Nico with a warm, if formal
    handshake. The guards stand by, waiting.

                                FREDERICO LARUSSO
                Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you
                will give my love to my niece, Rosa.
                                NICO
                I will do that, Mr. Larusso.
                (sincerely)
                I hope you will be well.

    LARUSSO
    nods: "Bene." Then: without a word he turns and exits
    back through the steel door.

    INT. O'HARE AIRPORT - BOARDING GATE - DAY

    Passengers file aboard a flight to Toronto. Hugs, goodbyes.
    Rosa, carrying the baby, is among the crowd moving toward
    the boarding door. Leaving with them are two of Branca's
    men. We PICK OUT Branca and two of his bodyguards near the
    fringes, looking inobtrusive but definitely on guard.

    CORNER NEAR BRANCA
    Hidden by a bank of phones, Sara clings to Nico, holding      
    him as tight as she can. When she releases him, we can't
    hear what she says, but it seems like, "Be careful, please be
    careful." Nico glances to Branca, who motions subtly to
    hurry.

    He squeezes Sara's hand, she joins the crowd swelling            
    toward the boarding door --
    CUT TO:

    EXT. O'HARE - RUNWAY - DAY (STOCK)

    watch from an open corner of a parking lot. As the plane
    begins its bank to gain altitude, Branca turns to Nico.
    The two bodybuards keep a discreet watch nearby.

                I could help you from here on.

    alone.

    Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close
    to home. Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything.
    One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open.

    Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and             
    Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who
    has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack?
    Run for it?

    He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls
    his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down,
    a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his
    feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who
    snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN
    FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a
    concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by
    GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A
    second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops
    from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind
    the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and
    valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in
    clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety.

    Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the
    garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the
    first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't
    hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man --
    Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling
    his gun. He  joins Zagon, rushing forward --

    RAMP TO LOWER LEVELS
    A valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car.
    Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind
    the wheel, leaping in --

    Nico floors it in reverse, slamming into Salvano, lifting

    Zagon's gun goes flying, but miraculously he spins away.
    Nico dives for him, gets his neck in a grip that is certain
    to snap it in half a second. But --

    appears in the torturer's hand.    It slashes Nico, right a-
    cross his already wounded ribs!    Nico cries in agony --
    ZAGON
    scampers free. Nico gets to his feet, bleeding. Nico is
    between Zagon and Zagon's machine gun on the ground. Zagon
    bolts for his car. Nico dives for the gun --

    Zagon floors it into a SCORCHING 360, BLASTS up the exit
    ramp, out of Nico's line of fire --

    NICO
    leaps   into the other, half-destroyed car. Its two front
    tires   are flat, windshield blown out, RADIATOR POURING STEAM.
    Nico   does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the
    metal   in reverse, BLASTS across the ramp divider, takes off
    after   Zagon in reverse --

    Rear TIRES CHURNING smoke, FRONT FLATS SCRAPING on their

    Zagon's car whips out into the night-time commotion.
    Pedestrians, POLICE SIRENS O.S. Zagon looks behind him --

    is trapped   by the traffic. Zagon looks around wildly, then
    floors the   accelerator. Zagon's car bucks straight up the      
    pedestrian   steps, onto the plaza! Strollers scream and
    scatter as   it fishtails wildly, careening toward the           
    huge stone   fountain --

    NICO'S WRECKED CAR

    Follows, pouring smoke, in reverse! Nico cuts Zagon off,
    CRASHES into Zagon's car broadside, sending it skittering        
    sideways into the fountain retaining wall --

    ZAGON
    leaps free, sprints toward the hotel alley.     Nico takes off
    after him on foot --

    EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF HOTEL - NIGHT
    Zagon races down the darkest of alleys, rounds a corner --
    NICO
    hurtles after him, gaining.     Nico whips around the alley
    corner, straight into:
    FOUR ARMED AGENTS
    waiting beside a plain grey TV remote van. Nico skitters         
    to a stop as a shotgun, an M-16 and two pistols cover him.
    Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire --

    weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull.
    ZAGON

    finishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink. He
    is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed.
    When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing
    to operate.

                                ZAGON
                We've got an hour before the
                honorable senator.
                (hands towel to
                pistol agent)
                You've got to learn to take time,
                smell the roses.

    Zagon turns to Nico.
                                NICO
                How are you gonna do him, Zagon?
                In a motorcade? Or passing
                through a hotel kitchen?
    The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and
    choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a
    small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch.
    Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter-
    rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes,
    scalpels, surgical tools.

                                ZAGON
                I've used these little beauties
                many times to extract information --
                (lifts a needle to
                the light)
                -- This'll be the first time I've
                ever used them... just for fun.

    Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted
    glove.
                                ZAGON
                (to agents)
                Take his arms.
    Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         
    seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon
    tight to Nico's head.


    Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair
    reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --

                                ZAGON
                Hold him up!
    Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him
    again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains
    from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands
    Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs
    off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico
    back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico
    looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the
    opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his
    beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes
    with defiance.

                                ZAGON
                This is where you came in, Toscani.
                Only, now it's where you're gonna
                check out.
    He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent
    and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon
    injects Nico.

    NICO
    reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under
    the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him-
    self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
                                ZAGON
                That's it. Fight it, cherry.
                Fight it, so it speeds faster on
                its way --
    Nico struggles more violently.

                                ZAGON
                Fight it. Till the vessels burst
                in your brain. Till the arteries
                rupture in your heart --

    Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go
    limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently.

                                ZAGON
                That's my boy. That's what I was
                waiting for --
    Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent
    and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens
    his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer,
    gloating, cooing --


                                ZAGON
                A fool learns from his own
                mistakes. But a wise man learns
                from the mistakes of others --
                (moves closer, blade
                in hand)
                You should have killed me when
                you had the chance, Toscani --

    The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs
    to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the
    cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped
    hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him
    ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor,
    half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-
    gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's
    face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing
    the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by
    inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.
    The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder
    holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping
    him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,
    spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun
    barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!
    Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with
    a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a
    double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun
    to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp
    scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He
    yanks the choke cable off his neck --

    ZAGON - AGAINST WALL
    On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,
    snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face
    battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.
                                ZAGON
                Can you feel the chemicals,
                cherry? You can't fight 'em much
                longer --
                                NICO
                Long enough to finish you.
    Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an
    animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon
    in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose
    and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's
    elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in
    a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against
    the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is
    screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs
    have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes
    are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of
    strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle
    free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-
    ing sound.

    As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up
    around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with
    one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did
    to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body
    crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers
    toward the door --
    INT. HOTEL LOBBY - REAR STAIRWELL - NIGHT

    A woman at a pay phone.    She turns, drops the receiver
    in shock as --
    NICO

    bursts, delirious, from the stairwell door!
    MAIN LOBBY - FRONT ENTRANCE

    A commotion as Lukich, Agent Neeley and Jackson, arm in a       
    sling, race in from their car.
    MAIN LOBBY - REAR - NICO
    weaves wildly forward. He drops to his knees.     Guests
    react in astonishment and horror.

    JACKSON
    is the first to spot Nico.    She runs up to him as he
    collapses.

    NICO
    looks at Jackson.
    LUKICH AND NEELEY                                               
    reach Nico and Jackson.

                                LUKICH
                (shouting for
                anyone)
                Is there a hotel doctor?    Call 911!

    NICO
    passes out in Jackson's arms. Behind them we see a banner,
    announcing Senator Harrison's address. From the ballroom we
    hear CHEERS and APPLAUSE. A fiery address is being finished
    inside. The senator is now leaving.
    FULL SHOT - LOBBY

    Total confusion. Guests staring everywhere. From a side
    office, a man with a medical bag comes running. The senator
    sees the group around Nico.

    FADE OUT.
    FADE IN ON:

    EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY

    Press vans outside; a crush of cars, reporters, neighbors.
    Newsmen are trying to gain access to the house, held back
    by several cops and some of Nico's more strapping
    relatives.

    BUICK STATION WAGON
    escorted by two police motorcycles, pulls in. The press
    surrounds it as Lukich, Neeley, Lieutenant Strozah and           
    Jackson, her arm in a sling, disembark from the car.
    SECOND CAR

    pulls up. Neeley walks over and opens the door as a court        
    stenographer, carrying her transcription machine case, steps
    out -- followed by a federal judge, CLAYTON ALSPAUGH and
    SENATOR ERNEST HARRISON.

    REPORTERS
    shove mikes and cameras at the senator and the judge, shouting
    questions. Lukich, Neeley and Strozah clear a path for them. 

    ANGLE FROM INSIDE HOUSE - THROUGH FRONT WINDOW
    Harrison and Alspaugh fend off the questions, cross the path
    and mount the steps to the house.
                                T.V. REPORTER (O.S.)
                (in front of house)
                -- Senator Harrison has today
                issued a statement calling for the
                appointment of a special prosecutor --
    CUT TO:

    INT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
    Nico, propped up on the couch, looking like hell, but de-
    finitely conscious and in full command of his faculties.
    Sara, Jackson, and Rosa beside him.                              
    TV

    A network ANCHOR delivers the headline news.
                                ANCHOR (V.O.)
                Earlier this week, the Harrison
                Commission delivered its report
                on the growing C.I.A. scandal to
                Congress...

    The image changes to SENATOR HARRISON behind a battery of
    microphones, sitting at a senate hearing-type table, with a
    plaque reading "SEN. ERNEST HARRISON" before him.
                                SENATOR HARRISON (V.O.)
                (on TV)
                -- officially-sanctioned deceit,
                murder and corruption, will
                continue until these men are
                brought to justice.

    NICO                                                        
    looks up as the real Senator Harrison, Judge Alspaugh and   
    the others enter the room. TV SOUND DOWN. Harrison stops
    before Nico, taking a moment to look with respect and ad-
    miration at the man propped up on the pillows.

                                SENATOR HARRISON
                Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally
                thank you. You are making it possible for
                a sliver of truth to finally come out.

    He holds out his hand.    Nico takes it.   The senator gestures
    to Judge Alspauch.

                                SENATOR HARRISON
                And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the
                fifth circuit court.
                                NICO
                Your Honor.
    The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up
    her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca,
    who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves              
    in tight beside Nico.
                                JUDGE ALSPAUGH
                Are you sure you're feeling well
                enough?
    Nico glances to Sara, to the supporting faces around              
    him. Lukich. Neeley. Strozah. Jackson. The others.                
                                NICO
                (to Alspaugh)
                If you're ready to listen, I'm
                ready to talk.
    CLOSE - STENOGRAPHER'S HANDS
    As the Judge's VOICE begins OVER, "slating" the depo-
    sitions, the stenographer's fingers start moving.
    PULL BACK TO:
    ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE ROOM

    The full scene. Nico telling his story.      Responsible
    officials recording it --

    EXT. YARD OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
    The press corps, vans, neighbors -- CLOSING CREDITS BEGIN.

    LONG PULLBACK

    to the street, the houses, and finally: the neighborhood.
    Nico's neighborhood, to which the truth has finally come
    home. CLOSING CREDITS CONTINUE OVER.

    FADE OUT.

    THE END
