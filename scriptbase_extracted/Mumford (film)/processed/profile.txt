Mumford
The mood of Mumford is clever, feel good, and touching.
The plot centers around doctors and patients, hidden identities, and starting over.
It is a drama, comedy, and romance movie.
Stylistically, Mumford is talky.
In approach, it is realistic.
It takes place, at least partly, in a small town.
Mumford happens in the 1990s.
