     :SC: JAWS 3-D

     FADE IN:

     AN UNDERWATER WONDERLAND                             

     Crystal green.  Beautiful fish of all colors and
     faces swarm happily by.  A spectacular undersea garden
     blooms like plants touched by springtime.  A quick-
     silver surface of color mirrors lush reef growth.

     SURREALISTIC CREATURES                                  

     Swim, creep, crawl, stalk, hide in their endless
     quest to survive.

     FISH                                            

     A beautiful aquarium of peace and tranquility.

     TERROR                                            

     The fish suddenly explode in panic, darting in all
     different directions, swimming instinctively for
     their threatened lives.

     GROUPER                                            

     300 pounds.  Awesome and ugly, swimming away as fast
     as it can go.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - GROUPER                                  

     As we come closer on it.
     Closer.
     It glances back, eyes wide with fear of impending death.
     It reverses course, ATTACKING CAMERA, and the grouper
     gets

     TORN IN HALF                                       

     Shredded by some unseen monster.  There's a violent
     THRASHING SOUND and clouding of the ocean, then quiet
     again as chunks of tissue float in the bloody brine.

     GROUPER'S HEAD                                       

     Drifts along, torn from its body.  Bug eyes open wide
     in death.

     CAMERA                                            

     Swoops around, moving quickly again.  On the surface,
     high above, something attracts its attention.  It goes
     to investigate.

     UNDERWATER SHOT OF WATER SKIERS                             

     Speeding over the surface.

     CAMERA                                            

     Let's now refer to it as SHARK, even though we do not
     see it.  It starts after the skiers.

     CUT TO:

     WATER SKIERS                                       

     Tanned, healthy, all-American boys and girls.  They
     come SHOOTING across the water in formation.

     SHARK POV                                       

     Follows after them, curious as to what's going on.

     SKIERS                                            

     Start forming a PYRAMID, climbing up onto each other.
     One of the girls is KELLY.  She's blonde and adorable
     and is climbing onto TOD's broad shoulders.

                    TOD
          The space shuttle has landed!

                    KELLY
          Hold still, damn it!

                    TOD
          What're you doing later?

                    KELLY
          Taking my boyfriend to the
          airport.

                    TOD
          (smiling)
          I thought I was your boyfriend.

     SHARK POV                                       

     Following along, piqued.

     SKIERS                                            

     The pyramid is formed.  The COACH in one of the speed-
     boats speaks through his bullhorn.

                    COACH
          Looking good, kids.  Real good.
          That's the way.  Keep it nice
          and tight.

                    TOD
          Keep it nice and tight, Kelly.

                    KELLY
          (giggling)
          I don't talk that way.

                    TOD
          Remember, skiers stay up longer.

                    KELLY
          Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!

                    TOD
          I am serious.

     SHARK POV                                       

     As it follows the skiers' wake...

     Slick corporate vice president.  Sea Kingdom is his
     baby.  He points to a large SCALE MODEL of the park as
     he talks to the crowd of press people and V.I.P.'s.

                    CALVIN
          Two years in the making, at a
          cost of seven million dollars,
          our new Under the Sea Kingdom

          Shark Encounter, where moving
          walkways take you safely through
          shark-infested waters.

     A pretty woman REPORTER has a question.

                    REPORTER
          What kind of sharks, Mister
          Calvin?

                    CALVIN
          Doctor Allen is our Marine
          Biologist and Mammalogist,
          formerly in charge of the state's
          Conservation Marine Laboratory.
          I think she can answer better
          than I.

     They all turn to

     KATHRYN                                            

     Dark hair, mid-twenties.  The brain matches the beauty.
     She is far more comfortable in the company of her
     dolphins.

                    KATHRYN
          Domesticated sharks, mostly.
          Mako.  Tiger.  Nurse.  Sand.

                    REPORTER
          Don't they attack each other?

                    KATHRYN
          Contrary to popular belief, when
          sharks are well fed, they will
          not hunt.

                    CALVIN
          (smiling)
          And we keep them well fed, so
          be kind what you say about us,
          or...

     They all chuckle.  Except Kathryn.

                    REPORTER
          You don't have a Great White.

                    KATHRYN
          No... And I really do have to
          get back to my own mammals, so,
          if you'll excuse me, please.

                    CALVIN
          Yes, of course.  Thank you for
          stopping by, Doctor.

     Kathryn gets out of there.

                    REPORTER
          It seems what you've created
          here is a combination Art
          Nouveau and Jules Verne.

                    CALVIN
          Exactly.

     CUT TO:

     WATER SKIERS                                       

     Up in their pyramid formation.  The Coach gives them
     praise through his bullhorn.

                    COACH
          Great, gang.  Beautiful!  Making
          me proud of you.

     KELLY                                            

     Fighting for her balance, her legs are wobbly.

                    KELLY
          Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm
          gonna go!

                    TOD
          Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!

                    JILL
          No, Kelly.  Not now!

                    TOD
          Lean back!

                    KELLY
          Ahhhhh!

                    BILL
          You fall, I'll kill you.  I
          swear I'll drown you.

                    KELLY
          Oh, God.  I can't...

     The Coach doesn't know what's going on.

                    COACH (V.O.)
          Now tomorrow, there's gonna be
          this great big banner that we
          break through here -- so now
          isn't the time to fall, Kelly.

     That's all Kelly needed to hear.

                    KELLY
          Ahh... ahhh... ohhhh...

                    SKIERS
          NO!

     TIMBER!

     Kelly falls, sending the entire pyramid pitching into
     the water.

                    TOD
          Aw... shit!

     SHARK POV                                       

     Up ahead, shadows thrashing through the water.  The
     shark rises to see what's going on.

     SKIERS IN WATER                                       

     Start reassembling as the speedboat idles, Evinrude
     RUMBLING.  The Coach barks at them through the
     bullhorn.

                    COACH
          What the hell was that all about?
          Kelly!

     The skiers grab hold of their lines, looking at Kelly.

                    KELLY
          (guiltily)
          Sorry, guys.

                    STEVE
          ... She did it again.

                    COACH
          Concentrate out there!  We can't
          have mistakes tomorrow!

     They're about ready to go again.  The boat starts to
     pull away.

     SKIERS                                            

     In their starting positions.  They come RISING out of
     the water as

     SHARK                                            

     Comes trailing in their wake, just seconds behind.  We
     see the tip of a giant triangular FIN cutting through
     the water, following them.  The fin is like a monstrous
     gray sail.  Up ahead, we see a giant set of

     GATES                                            

     Start closing, coming down.

     SHARK POV                                       

     It swims under the closing, heavy wire mesh gates.
     Gonna be a tight squeeze.

     WHAM-THUMP

     There's a shuddering vibration as the gate hits on
     something BIG.  The shark swims away as the gate
     CLANGS.

     CUT TO:

     DAISY AND BOBBY DOLPHIN                                  

     Going through their "paces."  Kathryn is in the water
     with them.  She blows a whistle and uses hand signals,
     giving affectionate rewards.

                    KATHRYN
          (to dolphins)
          What, Daisy?  What do you want?
          Tell me.

     The dolphin "talks" back to her.

                    KATHRYN
          (to other dolphin)
          Come here, Bobby.  Come on, give
          me a kiss.

     The dolphin gives her (and audience) a big wet kiss.

                    KATHRYN
          Thank you.

                    MIKE (O.S)
          Want another one?

     She turns to him and smiles.

                    KATHRYN
          Sure do.
          (to dolphin)
          Kiss me again, Bobby.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Laughing.  Take each other in their arms.  A soft,
     tender kiss, which the dolphins and penguin appreciate.

          Well, not much longer to go.

                    MIKE
          What is it, 97 days?

                    KATHRYN
          (laughing)
          Till this opens, not our wedding.

                    MIKE
          Hope I make it through both.

                    KATHRYN
          (kissing him)
          You will.  I'll see to it.

     Mike points to the nervous, chittering dolphins.

                    MIKE
          Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.

                    KATHRYN
          They're acting very strange
          suddenly.

                    MIKE
          Pre-opening jitters.

                    KATHRYN
          I guess.

     Mike's BEEPER goes off.  He sighs and speaks into it.

                    MIKE
          Brody here.

                    VOICE
          Mike, we're having a problem with
          the gate.

          What kind of trouble?

                    OPERATOR
          It's not closing, Mike.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          That's impossible.

                    OPERATOR
          I know.  But we show it's not
          closing.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Okay, okay... We'll get someone
          on it.

     CUT BACK TO:

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

                    MIKE
          Damn it.  I can't understand!
          (to her)
          I gotta go, hon.

                    KATHRYN
          Don't forget you have your
          brother.

                    MIKE
          Yeah.

                    KATHRYN
          See you later.

     They kiss and Mike turns at a RUMBLING SOUND.

     CRANE                                            

     Comes lumbering towards the water's edge.  Seated
     high on the boom with a camera is

     PHILIP HUTTON                                       

     A very refined, well-educated, aristocratic Englishman,
     30.  IKE directs the crane and SHELLY drives.  If you
     didn't know better, you might suspect there's something
     between the three of them.

                    PHILIP
          Bring the crane over.  Come down.
          Easy down.

                    MIKE
          Hey.

     Mike comes over to them.

                    MIKE
          Hutton, how the hell did you get
          my crane?

                    PHILIP
          Calvin said it was all right.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, well I didn't!

                    PHILIP
          Well, we're not going to hurt it,
          old boy.
          (to Kathryn)
          I say, love, is Flipper ready to
          go?

                    KATHRYN
          Go where?

                    PHILIP
          On the telly.  We're to film him
          for the evening news.

                    KATHRYN
          Nobody told me.

                    PHILIP
          I just did.  Can you make them
          do tricks?

                    KATHRYN
          They're not tricks.  They're
          behavior patterns.

                    PHILIP
          Fine.  Have them do some.

                    KATHRYN
          I don't know.  They're nervous
          and skittish right now.

                    PHILIP
          Yes, aren't we all.

     Kathryn turns in disgust, looking at Michael.

                    KATHRYN
          That macho pompous English --

                    MIKE
          Don't let him get you.  Just
          continue your patterns and
          pretend he's not around.

                    KATHRYN
          My imagination isn't that good.

                    MIKE
          Honey, I gotta go.

                    KATHRYN
          Okay, bye.

     Another soft kiss.

     As Mike passes Philip, he slaps the crane and calls
     up to Philip who's readying his camera.

                    MIKE
          Make sure you put this back.

                    PHILIP
          Aww, can't I keep it?

     Mike stares at him.  Takes an angry beat.  Philip
     still looking into the lens.  Mike leaves.

     Philip calls to Kathryn.

                    PHILIP
          Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or
          something.

                    KATHRYN
          Make this quick!

     She turns to her dolphins.

                    MIKE
          What happened?

                    SINGER
          I don't know.  It's off the track.

          Give me the walkie.

     Singer does.  Mike talks into it.

          No, Overman.

          Then we'll be done in a minute.

     Singer leans into the walkie-talkie.

          It's no use.  They won't come
          into the lagoon.

          dolphins.

                    PHILIP
          I thought they were clever.

                    KATHRYN
          I can have them walk backwards.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Watches with scorn as the start the crane up and
     leave.  Kathryn goes into the water, a look of
     determination.

     KATHRYN IN WATER                                  

     Stands to her knees, BLOWING a whistle and SLAPPING
     the water hard.

     BOBBY and DAISY                                       

     Look at her and respond in a cute but frustrating way.

                    KATHRYN
          No!  That is wrong!  What is the
          matter with you?

     Again, she blows the whistle and slaps the water three
     times as

          Everything's going wrong.  I'm

          than I ever have before.  I can't
          get him to respond.

                    MIKE
          How come?

                    KATHRYN
          I don't know.  I can't understand
          it.  Something's bothering them.

                    MIKE
          And what else is bothering you?

                    KATHRYN
          ... Hutton.  He really pisses me
          off.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, you really don't like him.

                    KATHRYN
          I don't like what he does.

                    MIKE
          It's his work.

                    KATHRYN
          He doesn't need the money.  He
          inherited a fortune.  He kills
          for kicks.  TV battles between
          non-predator fish and divers.
          The diver always wins.

                    MIKE
          Okay, forget him now.  I'm going
          to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?

                    KATHRYN
          I can't leave now.  We taking
          Sean out?

                    MIKE
          Sure.  Want to try that new
          Italian place?

                    KATHRYN
          No, you don't need all that
          starch.  You're getting too fat.

                    MIKE
          Not enough loving.

                    KATHRYN
          Get out of here!

     She playfully splashes water at him.  He yells and
     heads to shore.

     Overman looks around the deck.

          You see the three-quarter socket?

                    HARRIS
          Yeah.  Down there.

          at Captain Kidd's.

                    SINGER

     Singer and Harris put the equipment into the boat as
     Overman puts his mask back on.

     The diver enjoys this freedom; not encumbered with
     weights and tanks, he swipes at passing fish as he
     descends into the deep.  But suddenly, all the fish
     that were curiously inspecting him turn and scatter.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERMAN                                  

     Looks about, apprehensive eyes peering through his
     mask.  He looks again and continues diving.

                    KELLY
          You gonna work at The Kingdom?

                    SEAN
          Depends on big brother.

                    KELLY
          I'm a water-skier.

                    SEAN
          Are you really?

                    KELLY
          Sure am.

                    SEAN
          That's too bad.  I don't like
          water.  I don't like being around
          in.  I never go in it.

                    KELLY
          How come?

                    SEAN
          Goes back to when I was a kid.
          Mike's okay, he's gotten over
          his fears, but I haven't.  I
          can't even drink it.

     Mike comes over in a hurry.

                    MIKE
          Come on, let's go.

                    SEAN
          Something wrong?

                    MIKE
          You know Overman?

                    KELLY
          Musclehead?

                    MIKE
          He's missing.

                    KELLY
          Hope with none of my girl friends.

     EXT. AIRPORT - DAY                                  

     Mike and Sean and Kelly walk to the parking lot.

                    MIKE
          Kelly, could you look after Sean
          for a while?  Show him around for
          me?

                    KELLY
          Sure.  No problem.

                    MIKE
          Thanks.

                    SEAN
          Yeah, thanks.

     The brothers wink at each other.

     KATHRYN RIDING WHALE                                  

     She takes it through a series of moves, not noticing
     Mike and Sean and Kelly pull up in the Blazer.

                    SEAN
          Hi-yo-Silver!

     KATHRYN                                            

     Sees them and leaps off the whale.

                    KATHRYN
          Sean!

     She hops out of the tank and warmly embraces Sean.

                    KATHRYN
          MMMM.  It's good to see you again.

                    SEAN
          (meaning Mike)
          You really gonna marry this guy?

                    KATHRYN
          Well, I can't wait for you
          forever.

                    SEAN
          Why not?  Younger guys are in.

                    MIKE
          Okay, you two, have a good life
          without me.  I gotta go.

                    SEAN
          Don't hurry back.

     Mike leaves.  Kelly turns to Kathryn.

                    KELLY
          Doctor Allen, you think I could
          ride the whale sometime?

                    KATHRYN
          Sure, Kelly.

                    KELLY
          That'd be great.  I was a seal
          once, in another life, and
          whales were always my closest
          friends.

     They look at her.  Uh-huh.

     CUT TO:

     EXT. BREAKWATER - LATER                                  

     Mike's there with Harris and Calvin.

                    MIKE
          Why didn't you stay with him?
          You never let a diver go down
          alone!

                    HARRIS
          We were done, Mike.  He left a
          piece of equipment down there and
          went back for it.

                    CALVIN
          And hasn't been seen since.

                    HARRIS
          I waited for him.  When he didn't
          show, I went back.  There's no
          sign of him.  His gear's still
          on deck.  I went in looking for
          him.  All I found was this.

     We see the missing three-quarter socket wrench.

                    MIKE
          I don't understand.  Overman's
          too good a diver to disappear.

                    CALVIN
          Have you checked the bars?  The
          guy's irresponsible;  he's done
          this before.

                    HARRIS
          Yes, Mr. Calvin.  We've called
          all over.  Nobody's seen him
          and his truck's still here.

                    CALVIN
          I want him found.  He could be
          in the bars, he could be shacking
          up.  He could be out to sea

                    MIKE
          I'll need more men to look.

                    CALVIN
          Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have
          the manpower.

                    MIKE
          We're going to have to cover the
          entire lagoon.

                    CALVIN
          I know, but you're just going to
          have to find another way.  So you
          better start.

     Calvin leaves.

     A small two-seater, bobbing on the surface near the
     dolphin pen.  Kathryn turns to RUTH, one of her
     assistants.

                    KATHRYN
          I think they'll come out now.

                    RUTH
          They still seem nervous.

                    KATHRYN
          I know.

     Mike turns to Kathryn.

                    MIKE
          They're coming with us?

                    KATHRYN
          We play hide and seek all the
          time.  They find a lot of things.

     Mike looks at the tiny sub.

                    MIKE
          (skeptically)
          Where's the rubber band?

                    KATHRYN
          Look, Michael... you don't have
          to come.

                    MIKE
          I don't have a choice.

     She understands.

                    KATHRYN
          Well, let's go then.

     They ease into the sub.

                    MIKE
          How many coupons is this ride?

     INT. SUB                                       

     He squeezes into the front seat.  She's behind him.

                    MIKE
          What do I do now?

                    KATHRYN
          Take a deep breath and hold it.

                    MIKE
          That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.

                    KATHRYN
          (smiling)
          Just put your mask on.

     He inserts his respirator while she starts the engine.
     She puts her mask on.

                    KATHRYN

     BANG.  The sub starts filling with water.

     MIKE                                            

     Watching through his mask as the water surrounds him.

     He holds on tight.

          Honey... you all right?

                    MIKE
          No.

          Are you scared?

                    MIKE
          Yes.

          Let's head to the gate and work
          our way back.

                    KATHRYN
          That's a lot of ground to cover.

     The kids get a bath.

          You know, on our honeymoon, we

     SPANISH GALLEON                                       

     Wrecked in 1982, it looks like it's been down here
     for centuries.  Masts broken, cannons rusting, wood
     eaten away.  The sub circles it.

     PANNING GALLEON                                       

     The sub comes in low.  Nothing there, other than
     "priceless gold and treasure."  The sub moves in
     close as

     DOLPHINS POP OUT

     electrical system of Sea Kingdom, lights flickering on
     it.  There are also banks of instrument panels and TV
     monitor screens.  In the b.g. is a lock which connects
     the lagoon with the control room.  A crew of men and a
     woman are working in the room.  Outside, the submarine
     appears.

     A man at one of the control panels throws a switch
     activating radio communication between the control
     room and the sub as a BUZZER sounds.

          Make up your mind.

          What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd
          never have let you talk me into
          this.

                    KATHRYN
          I talked you into this?

                    MIKE
          I'd have fallen in love with a
          pilot or a mountain climber.

          Are you coming...?

                    MIKE
          No, I don't want to leave now.
          I'm having too good a time...
          Of course I'm coming!  You'd think

     GREAT WHITE SHARK                                  

     Ten feet of killer, coming at them.

     MIKE                                            

     Utter fear, his eyes terrified as he stares at the
     shark.

     FLASH CUT - JAWS I                                  

     Young Michael Brody being yanked from the water an
     instant before the Great White can eat him up.

     MIKE, KATHRYN AND DOLPHINS                             

     Mike gaping at the o.s. shark as Kathryn grabs onto
     Daisy's fin and pulls her to Mike.  She gestures for
     him to take the fin.  He doesn't respond, looks at
     the shark.

     THE WHITE                                       

     Coming closer, a chilling monster.

     MIKE, KATHRYN AND DOLPHINS                             

     Kathryn grabs Mike's hand and forcibly puts it on
     Daisy's dorsal fin, taps Daisy.  The dolphin and Mike
     are gone in a flash.  Looking at the shark, Kathryn
     feels for Bobby's fin, taps his head.  As quickly as
     Mike went, she is gone from view.

     RACE FOR SAFETY SEQUENCE                             

     Shots alternating between the dolphins, their speed
     reduced by the weight of pulling Mike and Kathryn, and
     the Great White in pursuit of them, getting closer and
     closer.

     EXT. DOLPHIN PEN GATE                                  

     The dolphins carry Mike and Kathryn through the narrow
     opening.  The instant they are inside, the Great White
     hurtles into FRAME and BANGS against the gate sides,
     too big to get through.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN SURFACE                             

     Scramble for dear life out of the water, rolling onto
     the dock.  They lie there, gasping, chests heaving.
     Mike slides over to Kathryn.

                    KATHRYN
          You all right?

                    MIKE
          I think so.  I'm not sure...
          Are you?

                    KATHRYN
          I'm okay.

     He holds her close.  She's trembling.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael...

                    MIKE
          It's all right, baby.  We're
          safe...

     DAISY AND BOBBY DOLPHIN                             

     Break the surface, chatting away.  Mike and Kathryn
     look at them and smile.

                    MIKE
          Thanks, guys.

     The dolphins almost answer "that's okay, but watch it
     next time."  Mike helps Kathryn to her feet, and they
     walk away, arms around each other.

                    KATHRYN
          How the hell did it get in here?

                    MIKE
          God, they're horrible.  I hate
          them.  Did you see its eyes?  How
          black they are?  The look in them?

                    KATHRYN
          Don't think about it.  It's over.

                    MIKE
          It's never over...  Here comes
          another six years of bad dreams.

     DOLPHINS                                       

     Watch them walk away, then DIVE back into the water.

     UNDERWATER                                       

     The shark is looking for something to eat.  Finds it.
     Gulp.

     EXT. FLORIDA FESTIVAL TENT - SUNSET                        

     Calvin's called an emergency meeting.  Mike, Kathryn,
     Philip.  Calvin's eating his dinner through SCENE.
     Ike and Shelly stand in b.g.  There's a heated
     discussion.

                    CALVIN
          What you're saying is we have a
          Great White shark in the lagoon.

                    MIKE
          And a missing man.

                    PHILIP
          Unhappy combination.  Most likely
          one's inside the other.

                    KATHRYN
          Sharks are man-biters, Mister
          Hutton.  Not man-eaters --

                    PHILIP
          (cutting her off)
          That's a load of codswopple.  A
          Great White doesn't fear man.  It
          doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy
          of food and blood.

                    KATHRYN
          I think we can capture it.  I'd
          like to try.

                    PHILIP
          That's preposterous!

                    CALVIN
          Go on, Doctor.

                    KATHRYN
          No one's ever caught a Great White
          except indirectly in fishing nets.
          I want to dart it and keep it
          alive.

                    CALVIN
          It would make a marvelous
          attraction;  the only Great
          White in captivity.

                    KATHRYN
          (confidently)
          I can get it.

                    PHILIP
          You can get killed!

                    KATHRYN
          I've handled sharks before.
          Bigger than this one.

                    PHILIP
          Calvin, let me go down there
          and kill the bastard.

                    KATHRYN
          No!

                    PHILIP
          (continuing to Calvin)
          It'll chop up half a million
          dollars of your tropical fish
          in two minutes.

                    KATHRYN
          Calvin, I insist I be allowed
          to capture it!

                    PHILIP
          Three hundred million years of
          evolution have created the
          greatest butcher the world's
          ever known.

                    KATHRYN
          It's one of the world's greatest
          creatures.

                    PHILIP
          A shark could have a hundred
          embryos in its sack.  You know
          how many are born?  Maybe five.
          They eat each other before birth!
          They're born killers!

                    KATHRYN
          The only Great White in captivity,
          Calvin.  All those people
          standing in line...

                    CALVIN
          All right, Kathryn.  Go ahead
          and get it.

                    KATHRYN
          I will.

                    PHILIP
          Well, then I'm going to film it.

                    KATHRYN
          Like hell!

                    PHILIP
          (to Calvin)
          Make a lovely item for "Good
          Morning, America"

                    CALVIN
          Absolutely.  Good idea.

                    KATHRYN
          (to Calvin)
          With those camera lights and...

                    CALVIN
          (interrupting)
          He's going with you, Doctor.

                    KATHRYN
          No, it will be too much
          distraction.  I don't want that
          many people in the water.  I'll
          go in, give it a belly shot, and
          get out.

                    CALVIN
          And Philip will be there to film
          it.  Now that's the end of it!

     Kathryn bites her lip, realizing.  She turns to Calvin.

                    KATHRYN
          I want that shark alive.

                    PHILIP
          So do I, love.

                    CALVIN
          Well, you'd better get started!

     He walks away.  Kathryn stares at Philip, who smiles
     and moves off with his men.  Mike comes up to Kathryn.

                    MIKE
          You're going down there again?

                    KATHRYN
          Yes.

                    MIKE
          After what happened to us?

                    KATHRYN
          I know I can capture it.

                    MIKE
          Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really
          crazy.  A suicidal maniac.

                    RUTH
          Twelve cc's

                    BRIAN
          That should do it.

     OVER TO PHILIP AND SHELLY                             

     Preparing their cameras.

                    PHILIP
          We'll shoot this with an .18,
          boys.

                    SHELLY
          That bugger moves fast.

                    PHILIP
          Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we
          may be down there for a while.

                    SHELLY
          (smiling)
          I wouldn't mind going down with
          her.

                    PHILIP
          She is a lovely bit of crumpet
          at that.

     OVER TO MIKE                                       

     Welding some kind of object.  Ike comes up to him.
     Ike's in his diving suit.

                    IKE
          Aren't you suiting up, mate?

                    MIKE
          No.

                    IKE
          Well, don't worry about your
          fiancee.  We'll watch over her.

                    MIKE
          She can take care of herself.
          She doesn't need you.

                    IKE
          Never know down there.  Helps
          to have a friend, sometimes.

                    MIKE
          How many sharks have you killed?

                    IKE
          Me?  I don't know.  Twenty,
          thirty.  I love them, think
          they're the greatest.

     He walks away.  Mike looks out at the water, staring
     at it.

     FLASH - FROM JAWS I                                  

     Young Mike Brody sees the lifeguard taken by the shark.

     BACK TO MIKE                                       

     He comes out of it in a gasping sweat.

                    KATHRYN (V.O.)
          Well, how do I look?

     He turns.
                    MIKE
          What?

     KATHRYN                                            

     Wears an iron CHAIN LINK SUIT over her diving suit.
     She has a light-hearted nervousness.

                    KATHRYN
          Do you like it?

     She models it for him.

                    MIKE
          Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's
          your designer?  Sassoon Shark?

                    KATHRYN
          I got it on sale.
          (touches links)
          A real steel.

                    MIKE
          Here.

                    KATHRYN
          What's that?

                    MIKE
          Bracelets.

     It's what he's been welding.  Forearm protectors
     which he places on her.

                    KATHRYN
          Fine piece of engineering.

                    MIKE
          Should protect you a little, from
          the compression.  If that thing
          gets ahold of you.

                    KATHRYN
          Thank you.

     She kisses him.  He takes her in his arms.

                    MIKE
          Kathryn...

                    KATHRYN
          Yes?

     He looks at her.  Wants to tell her to take that damn
     suit off.  To get off this boat and forget the fucking
     shark.  To go home with him, to bed.

                    MIKE
          ... I love you.

     She smiles.

                    KATHRYN
          Love you too.

     Mike nods and takes his beeper.

     Like a flower of sunshine unfolding, lights pop on
     from beneath the water, illuminating the lagoon.

     CUT TO:

     WORKBOAT                                       

     Mike and Kathryn watch the lights come on.

                    MIKE
          Wouldn't this whole thing be a
          little safer in the daytime?

                    KATHRYN
          It's easier to lure sharks at
          night.

                    MIKE
          Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?

                    PHILIP (V.O.)
          They're always hungry.  They
          eat anything.

     Philip enters.  He's wearing a bright orange diving
     suit.

                    PHILIP
          (continuing; touches
          her suit)
          ... even steel.

     Mike looks again at her protective suit.  She looks
     at Philip.

                    KATHRYN
          You look like an orange worm.

                    PHILIP
          Shark bait.  Draws them over for
          closeups.

                    KATHRYN
          What in hell is that?

     She points to a

     HAND GRENADE

     Strapped on his waist, right by his large knife.

                    PHILIP
          Lunch for Whitey.  Something to
          munch on in case things get
          dicey.

                    KATHRYN
          We're taking that shark alive!

                    PHILIP
          Let's hope he knows that.

                    KATHRYN
          I know it and I will not go down
          into this lagoon as long as you
          carry that!

                    PHILIP
          Why?

                    KATHRYN
          Because I don't trust you, that's
          why.

                    MIKE
          You set that thing off down there,
          you don't know what will happen.

                    PHILIP
          Precisely.

                    KATHRYN
          I insist you get rid of that bomb.

                    PHILIP
          Afraid I can't do that.

                    KATHRYN
          You're supposed to film it, not
          turn it to hash!

                    PHILIP
          Look, Doctor, this isn't one of
          your pet porpoises we're after.
          It's a torpedo of muscle.
          Murderous expertise!  I've seen
          bleeding sharks try to eat
          themselves!  Don't be so
          concerned about them.  Worry
          about yourself.

     He turns to go.

                    MIKE
          Hutton!

     He stops.  Turns.

                    MIKE
          You heard the lady.  Take it off.

     Tense pause.  Philip stares at Mike.  At Kathryn.
     Then his hand moves to the grenade.  He unclips it,
     holds it in his hand, and

     FLINGS IT TO MIKE

     Who catches it.  Philip walks away, smirking.  Mike
     makes a move after him, but Kathryn stops him.

     TV SCREEN                                       

     It's the shark.

                    OPERATOR
          We see him, Mike.  Between the
          stadium and the ski show island.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          All right, hit those lights too.

     CUT TO:

     MORE LIGHTS                                       

     Start popping on.

     CUT TO:

     WORKBOAT                                       

     Mike turns to Kathryn.  Tightens her tank straps.
     She holds a large SPEAR GUN.

                    MIKE
          Change your mind?

                    KATHRYN
          No.

                    MIKE
          You amaze me.  I'm more scared
          than you.

                    KATHRYN
          No, you're not.

     Mike pulls her face mask down and "kisses" her over
     it.  She goes over the side.

     CUT TO:

     PHILIP AND IKE                                       

     In their tanks and masks, ready to go.  Mike comes
     over to Philip.  Gives him back the grenade.

                    MIKE
          Here.  Don't let anything happen
          to her.

     Philip smiles and nods, clips the grenade to his waist
     and dives, taking us

     UNDERWATER                                       

     Kathryn and Philip and Ike all start kicking down.

     CUT TO:

     MIKE ON WORKBOAT                                  

     Watches the bubbles break the surface.  He turns to
     Shelly.

                    MIKE
          This is ridiculous.  We should
          blow the mother's head off.

                    SHELLY
          Couldn't agree more.

     CUT TO:

     UNDERWATER                                       

     As the three kick downward.  Philip and Ike prepare
     to film.  Kathryn notices Philip checking his power-
     head and reacts sharply.  He notices and gives her a
     mocking salute, making her angrier yet.  Turning, she
     starts toward the circling shark.

     THE SHARK SEQUENCE                                  

     Intercutting between Kathryn, Philip and Ike and, on
     the deck of the workboat,  Mike and Shelly.  Kathryn
     moves toward the shark until it starts to circle her,
     Philip and Ike beginning to film.

     Her expert maneuvering is not lost on Philip, and he
     watches with interest -- Mike, on the boat deck,
     watches what he can with apprehension -- as Kathryn
     slowly lures the shark toward her.

     Suddenly, it darts in at her and she jabs the spear
     at it (into the audience), causing it to veer away.
     Kathryn seems surprised by this.  The shark begins to
     circle her again, CAMERA PANNING with her as she keeps
     an eye on it.  Philip and Ike keep filming, Mike keeps
     watching tensely on the deck as Kathryn positions
     herself, holding the spear extended, moving it back
     and forth.

     Abruptly, the shark darts in, moving so precipitously
     that it goes all the way to Kathryn.  She ducks and
     the shark's jaws clamp shut on her air tanks.  Philip
     reacts to this and starts forward to help her as the
     shark begins to shake her violently from side to side.

     Letting go of the spear, she tries to hit the shark in
     the eye but has no success.  Philip shows up, and she
     waves him off.  He cannot believe her reaction but
     doesn't draw his powerhead, only hitting the shark on
     the head with the camera.  This makes it let go of
     Kathryn's tanks and back off fast.  Philip shoving it
     aside as it passes him, drawing his powerhead just to
     be safe.  The shark does not attack him though, but
     retreats.  Philip looks at Kathryn.  She is shaken up,
     but the chain-mail suit has protected her from injury.
     She waves him back irritably.  Shaking his head either
     at her or her stupidity, he backs off to Ike,
     keeping a wary eye on the shark as Kathryn kicks up to
     the surface to get another spear.  On deck, Mike tries
     to speak to her as she grabs the spear, but she is
     under again before he can say a word.  Kathryn grimly
     sets herself again.  Seeing this, Philip casts his
     eyes heavenward, as though thinking, "Dear God, the
     woman's suicidal."  She jabs the spear toward the
     still lingering shark.  Finally, after making a few
     nervous passes, it goes for her.  This time, she is
     able to shoot the sedating spearhead into its stomach,
     then kicks up toward the surface as fast as she can,
     the shark starting after her.

     SURFACE                                            

     As she breaks through.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael!

     Mike and Shelly rush there, reach down, and grab her
     hands to haul her up.  As they do, the shark comes
     after her.  They yank her over the railing an instant
     before it lunges out of the water and almost bites
     her feet off, jaws slamming shut in close shot as it
     misses, its body crashing back into the water.
     Kathryn looks at Mike, her face decidedly pale.  She
     attempts to smile.

                    KATHRYN
          (meekly)
          ...  I told you I'd get it.

     The shark bellies up.

                    MIKE
          I can use a shot of what he's got.

                    KATHRYN
          ... Me, too.

     Her legs go watery, and she leans against the railing.
     Mike embraces her.

     CUT TO:

     INT. TANK ROOM - UP ANGLE ON CEILING                        

     The roof has been opened, and the shark is being
     lowered into the room on the litter.  CAMERA DOWNPANS
     with it to reveal Brian and Ruth preparing to get the
     shark into the tank, Philip, Shelly, and Ike filming it.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     He is drying her off with a large towel, rubbing her
     down good.  She is cold and shivering.

                    MIKE
          After this has opened, when
          everything's settled down, you
          and I are going away.  Just the
          two of us.  No dolphins, no
          sharks, no whales, no penguins.
          Just you and me.

                    KATHRYN
          Sounds wonderful.

                    MIKE
          We'll go to Palm Springs, Death
          Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace
          where there's no water.

     She kisses him and turns at a familiar SOUND.

     DOLPHINS                                       

     In an adjoining tank, curiously watch the shark being
     lowered.  The dolphins chatter away.  Kathryn tells
     them:

                    KATHRYN (V.O.)
          Don't be afraid, it's okay now.

     The dolphins don't believe her.  They dive for safety.

     BACK TO MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     Smiling.  She shrugs off the towel as Brian calls her.

                    BRIAN
          We're ready for you.

                    KATHRYN
          I have to walk him till the drug
          wears off.

                    MIKE
          You want me to stay?

                    KATHRYN
          (kissing)
          Get some sleep.  And tell Sean
          I'm sorry.

                    MIKE
          (remembering)
          Sean, that's right...

     Mike turns to leave, accidentally crossing in front
     of Philip's shot.

                    PHILIP
          Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining
          the shot.

                    MIKE
          Kind of dull in there for you,
          isn't it?  Why don't you throw
          in another shark?

     He walks out.

     Kathryn hurries into the tank with Brian and Ruth.
     They unfasten the shark from the litter and start to
     walk it.  The litter is raised back up.

                    RUTH
          He's a young one.

                    KATHRYN
          And big for his age.

     They walk on.

     CUT TO:

     GRASSY KNOLL                                       

     Sean and Kelly are lying on the ground making out as
     Mike's voice comes over the park P.A. system.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Sean.  Sean, where are you?

                    KELLY
          Someone's looking for you.

                    SEAN
          That's Mike.  Let him look.

     He kisses her some more.

                    MIKE (V.O.)
          Sean?  You there?

     Kelly gets to her feet, pulling Sean up too.

                    KELLY
          Come on, it's getting late, and
          I have an early call.

     They walk off, arms around each other.

     CUT TO:

     INT. TANK ROOM - LATER                                  

     Ruth sleeps on a floor mat.  Kathryn and Brian are
     still walking the shark.  Both look very tired.

                    KATHRYN
          Why don't you take a rest, Brian?

                    BRIAN
          I'm only walking him.  You caught
          him.  You have to be exhausted.

                    KATHRYN
          Go on, you're tired.

                    BRIAN
          No, I'm fine, thanks.

     They stop talking, keep walking.

     PHILIP

     Comes in, wearing his jogging suit.

                    PHILIP
          How's sleeping beauty?

                    KATHRYN
          Still sleeping.

                    PHILIP
          Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into
          a frog.

                    KATHRYN
          (smiling)
          Should be coming out of it soon.

                    PHILIP
          Just watch it when he does.

     Philip lowers himself into the water and moves to
     Brian.  Taps him on the shoulder.

                    PHILIP
          May I cut in?

     Brian looks over at Kathryn, who's about to say no,
     then nods it's okay.

                    BRIAN
          He's all yours.

     Philip takes his place alongside the shark.  He smiles
     at Kathryn.

                    PHILIP
          Could be a new dance...  Walking
          the Shark.

                    KATHRYN
          (smiling back)
          Thanks for helping.

                    PHILIP
          Not at all.

                    KATHRYN
          Why are you?

                    PHILIP
          I like it when they wake up.

                    KATHRYN
          So do I.  But for different
          reasons.

                    PHILIP
          And I like you.

     They keep walking it.

                    PHILIP
          You were quite daring in
          capturing him.  Very skillful
          indeed.

                    KATHRYN
          Skillful?  I missed my first shot.

                    PHILIP
          Some miss all their shots.

                    KATHRYN
          Somebody could have gotten hurt.

                    PHILIP
          That's what life is, Doctor.
          Full of chances to hurt yourself,
          or somebody else.

                    KATHRYN
          You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.

                    PHILIP
          Philip.

                    KATHRYN
          Before, you were ready to feed
          this shark a hand grenade.  Now
          you're helping to nurse it back
          to life.

                    PHILIP
          That's because I am the shark.

                    KATHRYN
          We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton.
          Our destiny is linked to the fate
          of the oceans.  By continuing to
          destroy fish, man destroys himself.

                    PHILIP
          The grenade's just to intimidate
          Whitey.  He knows I have it, so
          he watches out.  Same is true when
          I film lions, tigers, rhinos...

     She studies his smile.

                    KATHRYN
          I think that you and I are
          natural enemies.

                    PHILIP
          And here I thought I was
          charming you.

     The shark quivers, showing signs of waking.

                    PHILIP
          Hello.  I think his nap's over.

                    KATHRYN
          Get ready to go.

                    PHILIP
          Believe me, I am.

                    KATHRYN
          (calls)
          Brian, he's coming around!

     They walk it a little more and

     THE SHARK AWAKENS                                  

     Comes INSTANTLY back to life with an EXPLOSIVE recovery.
     Kathryn and Philip leap aside to get out of there, but
     the shark SLAMS Kathryn against the side of the tank,
     knocking the breath out of her.

     PHILIP INTERVENES                                  

     So does Brian, who comes jumping into the tank.  Philip
     uses his feet to keep the shark away from Kathryn, but
     they both almost get CRUSHED by the body.  Philip flips
     her out of the tank as the shark comes lunging around
     at him.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - PHILIP                                  

     Gets out of there just in time, as the shark just
     misses chomping his evacuating ass.  Brian's out of
     there safe.

     KATHRYN AND PHILIP                                  

     Look down as the shark swims in rapid circles.

                    PHILIP
          Well, Doctor.  You've got your
          shark.

                    KATHRYN
          Thanks to you.

     There's a near moment of tender contact between them.
     Philip smiles and nods at her and leaves, doing his
     best Bobby Darin.

                    PHILIP
          (singing "Mack the
          Knife")
          Oh when the shark bites,
          With his teeth, dear,
          Scarlet billows start to spread...

     She watches him with an intrigued smile.

     CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  

     Kathryn comes quietly in.  Starts undressing in the
     dark.  Mike softly speaks to her from the bed.

                    MIKE
          All well in the Kingdom of the
          Sea?

     She smiles and sits on the bed.

                    KATHRYN
          Finally.

                    MIKE
          How's your patient?

                    KATHRYN
          Recovering nicely.

                    MIKE
          Me, too.

     She falls into his arms, and they kiss.

                    KATHRYN
          Mmmm... you smell good.

                    MIKE
          (smiling)
          You don't.

                    KATHRYN
          It's my new perfume.  Great White,
          the Man-Eater.

     She nibbles his ear, neck.  He pulls her down to him,
     they kiss passionately.

     CUT TO:

     LAGOON - NIGHT                                       

     All is still and quiet.  A NOISE is heard from beneath
     the water.  A faint almost ROAR, and the water is
     shaken by a giant form that sends a wave rolling to
     the CAMERA.  Then, whatever it was turns and returns
     to the deep.  The surface of the water rocks and
     trembles.

     CUT TO:

     SHARK ATTACK                                       

     They're in a feeding frenzy.  They rip, tear, chewing
     on tuna, each other.  Anything in the water.

                    PHILIP (O.S.)
          Playful bastards, wouldn't you
          say?

     REVEALING                                       

     Philip and Ike and Shelly watching the footage on a
     Moviola screen.  They drink beer and watch.

                    IKE
          Brings back such pleasant
          memories.

                    PHILIP
          Was a rather enjoyable afternoon,
          wasn't it?

                    SHELLY
          You want to show this?

                    PHILIP
          Absolutely.  The audience will
          stain their drawers.
          (smiles)
          I did.

     He walks for the door.  Opens it.

     PHILIP                                            

     Stands outside his EXHIBIT BOOTH, taking in the start
     of a new day.  There's photos and signs:  PHILIP HUTTON
     PRESENTS KILLERS OF THE DEEP.  There's books and T-
     shirts and toys too.  Ike joins him outside.

                    IKE
          Gonna be a beautiful day.

                    PHILIP
          And a profitable one.

     They smile at each other.

                    PHILIP
          Come on,  I'll buy you breakfast.

     CUT TO:

     OPENING DAY SHOTS                                  

     As final last-minute preparations are made.

     A.  Mini-buses being washed and decorated.

     B.  Sea shows in final rehearsal.

     C.  The Skiers getting dressed.

     D.  The mini-sub being worked on at the dock.

     E.  Food trucks delivering.

     F.  The ushers and usherettes, looking good.

     G.  Divers reaching the lagoon.

     H.  Control Room Underwater -- all is ready for lift-
     off.

     I.  Maintenance crews washing, scrubbing, polishing.

     TWO DIVERS                                       

     Come up.  They shake their heads "nothing."  They
     dive again.

     CUT TO:

     INT. TANK - DOLPHINS                                  

     Activating one of the symbol controls again and again.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM                                  

     Mike and BOB talk.

                    BOB
          We've been looking all night,
          Mike.  I don't think he's out
          there.  If he drowned, I think he
          went down on the bay side of the
          gate and the current pulled him
          out.  It was pretty strong when
          the men were working there.

                    MIKE
          Did you look in the intake passage?

                    BOB
          You can't even get in there, the
          incoming flow is so strong.  It
          would wash the body out anyway.

                    MIKE
          Well, I don't know.  Maybe he
          isn't down there.  Keep checking
          with everyone who knows him.
          I'll be at my office.

     He leaves.

     CUT TO:

     ENTRANCE TO SHARK ENCOUNTER TUNNEL                        

     Mike's walking as Kathryn comes from the other side.

                    KATHRYN
          Mike!

     He turns and she skips up to him.

                    KATHRYN
          (continuing)
          They said you'd be here.

                    MIKE
          What's up?

                    KATHRYN
          I need more pressure in the
          shark tank.

                    MIKE
          Okay.

                    KATHRYN
          I want to make sure the White is
          getting enough flow.  Would you
          do that for me?

                    MIKE
          Sure.  Let's go.

     She stops him.

                    KATHRYN
          No, we'll go through here.

                    MIKE
          ... Mean through the tubes?

                    KATHRYN
          Yes.  It's faster.

          MIKE
          No,  I'm not going through there.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael, come on, don't be silly.
          This is the quickest way.  You're
          not going to walk all the way
          around?

                    MIKE
          I'm not going to walk through
          that shark arcade.

                    KATHRYN
          They're not going to hurt you.
          They're encased in plastic.

                    MIKE
          I don't want to see them, Kathryn.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael, I don't have time.
          Please!  It's time you dealt with
          this and got over it.  Now come on!

     She takes his hand and leads him into the tunnel.

     SHARK TUNNEL                                       

     Mike is very apprehensive as the SHARKS encroach upon
     them from all angles.  He can't look at them.

                    KATHRYN
          Calvin wants me to move the White
          for tomorrow.

                    MIKE
          ... He ought to put him in here.

                    KATHRYN
          It's too soon to move him.

                    MIKE
          So tell Calvin.

                    KATHRYN
          I did.  He wants it on exhibit.

                    MIKE
          Well, that's why you got it.

     They walk on a bit, then Mike leans against the tunnel
     wall, eyes closed.

                    KATHRYN
          Mike... you okay?

     He's taking deep breaths.  He's very pale and perspiring.

                    MIKE
          It's back...

     She goes to him.

                    KATHRYN
          What's back?

     He's fighting some inner demon, and losing.  The sharks
     come swimming by him.  He stares them in the eye.  There
     seems to be thousands of them.

                    KATHRYN
          Honey, what is it?

                    MIKE
          Hydrophobia...

                    KATHRYN
          Michael, take deep breaths.

                    MIKE
          I have to get out of here.

                    KATHRYN
          Come on.

                    MIKE
          I can't take water, Kathryn.

                    KATHRYN
          Yes, you can.

                    MIKE
          I can't!  My dad had it, and I
          don't know if you can inherit
          it or what, but I got it, and I
          hate it.  I can't stand it!

     He RUNS out of there, running for his life, leaving
     her behind.  She watches him go.

     MOVE FROM THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW                        

     Out into the water.  A shark.  We move in on its black
     eye, till the eye fills the SCREEN.

     SHOCK CUT TO:

     EXT. LAGOON - DAY - CLOSE ON CANNON MUZZLE                   

     The same size as the eye in the previous shot, ROARING
     as the cannon is fired.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
     the cannon on the deck of a motorized pirate vessel
     which is carrying on its deck a gathering of politicians,
     press representatives, TV newsmen, and celebrities.  It
     sails across the lagoon, flags whipping in the wind,
     cannons THUNDERING.  CAMERA PANS UP and we see the
     words THE NEW SEA KINGDOM WELCOMES YOU moving across
     the sky, towed by a single-engine plane.

     CROWD ARRIVING                                       

     The great American Tourist invasion.  They come in cut-
     offs and sandals, Kodaks and sunglasses.  They come in
     every size, shape, and colored getup.  Old and young,
     they CHARGE.

                    P.A. VOICE
          Welcome to Sea Kingdom, and the
          excitement and discovery of
          earth's inner space.  For the
          whale and dolphin shows, please
          stay to the right.  The underwater
          tunnels are straight ahead...

     THREE MERMAIDS                                       

     Very pretty in their fishtail suits.  They answer the
     tourists' questions.

     Dangling out of the HOT AIR BALLOON, filming.  Ike is
     the pilot.

                    IKE
          Hardly like the Falklands.

     Philip calls over the bullhorn to the gaping tourists
     below:

                    PHILIP
          If you'll all squeeze a bit
          closer, everybody, you can
          see yourself tonight on the
          evening news.

     FAT WOMAN TOURIST                                  

     A 200-pounder in shorts, hat, and sunglasses squeezes
     into the shot.  She looks up, smiling and waving at
     the hot air balloon.  She shoves in closer, loses her
     balance, and falls into the lagoon.

     PHILIP                                            

     Watches woman splashing about.

                    PHILIP
          Well, seems a new whale show has
          been added.

     They laugh.

     KELLY                                            

     As usual, is fighting for balance.  Teetering on the
     edge, she lets out a desperate warning cry.

                    KELLY

     Nope, still up there.

     SKIERS                                            

     Make their sweeping turn and head in to shore.  They
     come neatly out of the pyramid.

     KELLY                                            

     Makes a graceful 3-point landing, gliding onto the

     thrilled at her accomplishment.

                    KELLY
          I did it,  I did it!

     She leaps on Tod, hugging him exuberantly.

                    SKIERS
          Way to go, Kelly!
          You were great!

                    KELLY

     Everyone enjoying the scary walk.  We see the giant
     squid tentacles reaching over the glass.  Kids scream.
     Now it seems as if one tentacle has actually BROKEN
     THROUGH, but it's only an illusion.  An EEL flies out
     of a cave and charges.

     INT. EXHIBIT                                       

     Brian and Ruth are walking the shark.  The exhibit is
     PACKED with tourists, gaping down, watching.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Bursts through onto the floor, kicking her shoes off
     on the run.  She jumps into the tank.

                    KATHRYN
          When did this happen?

                    RUTH
          Ten minutes ago.

                    BRIAN
          It hasn't adjusted.

                    KATHRYN
          Get the hose!  We've got to force
          more water through the gills and
          oxygenate him!

     Brian scampers out of the tank for the hose.

                    KATHRYN
          I knew it;  it's my fault.  We
          moved it too soon.

                    RUTH
          Don't blame yourself.

                    KATHRYN
          I should have never listened to
          Calvin.

     They walk the shark.

                    RUTH
          Kathryn...

                    KATHRYN

          ... Goddamn it.

     The shark is dead.  It floats over, belly up.

     KATHRYN

     Takes a painful moment, looking at the shark.

                    RUTH
          No one's ever done it before.
          It was a good try...

                    KATHRYN
          Not good enough.

                    RUTH
          We got it to live for ten hours.
          That's some kind of record.

     She turns from the shark and looks up at all the

     TOURISTS                                       

     Gaping down, taking pictures, grumbling.

                    TOURISTS
          Big deal.
          Let's get our money back.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          Look, Mommy, the shark's dead.

                    MOM
          Yes, dear.  Come on.

     They start to leave with the others.  Some still stare
     and wait.

     KATHRYN                                            

     The disappointment and disgust is evident.  Brian puts
     a comforting arm around her.

                    BRIAN
          Don't feel bad.

                    KATHRYN
          (resigned)
          Okay... Have them get it out of
          the tank.

     She climbs out of the tank.

                    SEAN
          Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean,
          you're responsible for building
          all this.  What a job you've done!
          Maybe I'll quit school and come
          down here and work with you.
          Brody Brothers Construction.
          We've always wanted to do that
          together.  Boat building.

                    MIKE
          It's not that easy.  Worked
          construction every summer to get
          through school.  Three years
          apprentice in the park's
          engineering department, and two
          years to build all this.  Finish
          school first, Sean.  Then make up
          your mind.  If you still want to
          work with me, we'll have plenty of
          time.

                    SEAN
          You and Kathryn gonna stay here?

                    MIKE
          This company's expanding.  They
          got parks in Texas, Ohio,
          California.  I think I'm gonna
          be going to Waco.

                    SEAN
          Well, Dad asked me to ask you
          this, about the wedding.  Is
          there any chance you and Kathryn
          will get married in Amity?

                    MIKE
          Tell Dad we're getting married
          in Las Vegas.  In one of those
          chapels.  He can meet us there.

                    SEAN
          (laughing)
          Yeah, he'll really go for that.

                    MIKE
          It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's
          fine with me if it's fine with
          her.

          Sean!

     Sean looks over as he hears his name called.  Kelly's
     running over to them.

                    MIKE
          She still talking to you?

                    SEAN
          We're in love.

                    MIKE
          Sure.

                    SEAN
          No, really.  I've never met
          anyone like her before.  This
          is it.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, right.  That's what you
          said about Janet, and Beth, and
          Barbara --

                    SEAN
          Puppy love.  This time it's real!
          We can have a double wedding.

     Kelly is upon them.  She's in her warm-up suit and
     looks adorable.  Sean greets her with a hug and a
     kiss.

                    SEAN
          You were great out there!

                    KELLY
          Did you see me?!  Wasn't I
          terrific?

                    SEAN
          As always.

     They kiss again.  Kelly sees Mike.

                    KELLY
          Hi, Mike.

                    MIKE
          How you doing, Kelly?

                    KELLY
          (sniffling)
          I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think
          I'm catching a cold.

                    MIKE
          Better than catching Sean's
          herpes.

     An astounded glare.

                    KELLY
          Herpes?

                    SEAN
          Why you sonuvabitch...

                    MIKE
          (leaving)
          See you tonight.

     Mike smirks away as Kelly grabs Sean.

                    KELLY
          Sean, do you have herpes?

                    SEAN
          No.  Of course not.  Don't listen
          to him.  He's - he's...
          (laughing)
          ... my brother.

     They kiss.

                    KELLY
          I'm not in the next show.  What
          do you want to do?

     He looks at her and grins.

                    KELLY
          Besides that.

                    SEAN
          I don't know, what else is there?

                    KELLY
          (excitedly)
          I know!  We can take the gondola
          ride!

                    SEAN
          The one that goes underwater?

                    KELLY
          Yes, it's great!

                    SEAN
          No, Kelly, I don't want to...

                    KELLY
          Come on, it's fun!

                    SEAN
          Not for me.  I don't go in the
          water, remember?

                    KELLY
          You're not in the water.  You're
          in a gondola.

                    SEAN
          No, think of something else.

                    KELLY
          Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're
          acting very immature.

                    SEAN
          I'm not acting!  I don't want to
          go in it, okay?

     She's dragging him by the hand.

                    KELLY
          Well, I do!  Time you got over
          this wet dream.  Nothing's gonna
          hurt you.  Now c'mon, we're
          going on it!

     He very reluctantly goes with her.

          No.  This one's fun.  You'll

     They press to the glass for a closer look.  We see
     some kind of FORM, floating.

                    BECKY
          I don't know.  Some kind of
          crab?

          Your friend Overman picked a
          hell of a time to come back.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, poor bastard.

                    PHILIP
          I lost a good cameraman in
          Australia last year.  A Great
          White chopped him in half with
          one bite.

                    MIKE
          Hey, I don't want to hear.

          That's how they do it, you know.

          I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our

          say goodbye, and good luck.

                    MIKE
          Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a

          No, South Georgia.

          Polar bears.

          Polar bears in Georgia???

          How come you're so brave with all
          this stuff?

                    PHILIP
          Tradition.  Royal sense of
          adventure that's been in my family
          for centuries.  Dates back to the
          Crusades and King Richard.  What
          I was born to do.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't
          it?

                    PHILIP
          Reach for the limit I always say.

     She takes a beat, looks around, and moves quickly to
     the bar.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael.

     They both look at her as she comes up to them.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael, look at this.

     She shows us what's in her hand.

     A VERY BIG SHARP TOOTH

     Mike looks at it.

                    MIKE
          Put it under your pillow and
          sleep on it and the tooth
          fairy will --

                    KATHRYN
          It's a shark's tooth!

                    MIKE
          So?

                    KATHRYN
          It was removed from Charlie
          Overman's body.

                    PHILIP
          May I?

     He takes the tooth.  One look and he knows.

                    PHILIP
          ... The bigger to eat you with.

     He and Kathryn exchange an understanding that Mike
     doesn't.

                    MIKE
          (confused)
          What's the big deal?  A shark got
          Overman, and we got the shark.

                    KATHRYN
          That's just it, Michael.  We
          don't!

                    MIKE
          What do you mean, we don't?

                    KATHRYN
          This tooth is from another shark.
          A shark that could be 30 feet long!

                    MIKE
          Thirty feet???

                    PHILIP
          Actually, thirty-five is probably
          more accurate.

                    MIKE
          That's impossible.  If it's that
          big, why hasn't anybody seen it?
          Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like
          not seeing the Goodyear blimp in
          a swimming pool.

                    KATHRYN
          That's what I've come to ask you.
          Is there any large place that has
          a strong current of water flowing?

                    MIKE
          I don't understand.

     His BEEPER starts signaling.  He ignores it.

                    KATHRYN
          Sharks have to keep moving.  They
          can never stop or they'll suffocate.
          If water isn't always flowing
          through them, they'll die.

                    PHILIP
          Is there such a place?  A cave
          or something with such a flow?

                    MIKE
          I don't know...  I can't think
          offhand of one.

     He reaches for his signaling beeper.

                    MIKE
          Yeah, what is it?

     open, it tries to eat the viewing glass, then turns.
     Its body thunders against the window, shaking it as
     people SCREAM and panic for the door.

          Coming through, please!

     Philip is standing and screaming.

                    PHILIP
          Move your bloody asses!

     Mike tries to drive through-around the crowd.  They
     yell back at him.  Mike grabs his beeper and calls in.

                    MIKE
          This is Brody, get the skiers
          out of the water!  We got a
          shark loose!  A Great White!

          Yes, Calvin, yes!  It's the
          biggest shark I've ever seen.  A
          female.  I think the other one was
          hers.  You have to get the skiers
          out.

     MIKE AND PHILIP                                       

     Now there are so many tourists in front of them, the
     cart is useless.  They jump out of it and RUN for the
     ski show stadium.  Those in their way get knocked aside.

                    TOURISTS
          Hey, where the hell you going?!

     Looking toward the lagoon, sees something.

     MIKE AND PHILIP                                       

     Keep running, pointing, and yelling.

                    MIKE
          Shark!  Shark!

     But his warning is drowned out by the participating
     audience caught up in the show.

                    AUDIENCE
          Hatfields!
          McCoys!

     Mike grabs one of the show's MANAGERS.

                    MIKE
          Get them in!  There's a shark out
          there!

                    MANAGER
          You're kidding, aren't you?

                    MIKE
          Get them out of the water!

                    MANAGER

     Does a fancy turnabout.  Skiing backwards, he looks
     aghast as he spots something in the water coming after
     them.

                    TOD
          Holy shit!

     He completes his turn-around and skis on, looking back
     over his shoulder.  One of the GIRL SKIERS notices him
     looking.

                    GIRL
          Hey, what'd you lose?

                    TOD
          Huh... nothing... just don't
          fall.  Just don't fall!

     He glances back again.  The fin follows, then dives
     beneath the surface.

          What are you doing?  I'm doing a
          show.  Give me that.

     about with great concern.

     SKIER                                            

     Does a JUMP, coming off a ramp.  Airborne, he glances
     down in disbelief as he FLIES over the monstrous form
     swimming beneath him.

                    SKIER
          Holy shit!

     He lands and keeps going.

     SKIERS

     make their sliding breakaway and clamber up onto the
     pad and safety.

     MIKE AND PHILIP                                       

     Are amongst those helping them out.  The skiers

          What's your plan, Brody?

                    MIKE
          It's easy.  Put a net on the
          derrick.  Put the net in the
          water by the intake passage.
          Turn off the intake passage.
          Shark comes out into the net
          and is hauled up.

          A piece of pie on Sunday.

                    KATHRYN
          The net would have to be secured
          by the intake passage.

          That's right.

                    KATHRYN

          But you --

                    MIKE
          (cutting her off)
          It's a construction job.  I'm
          the only one that can do it.

                    PHILIP
          I'll go with you.

                    MIKE
          No way.

                    PHILIP
          I'll stay out of your way.  I
          won't interfere.

                    MIKE
          I'm sure you won't.  But you're
          going to have to wait till we
          come up.  Then you can film all
          you want.

     He starts for the door as Kathryn grabs him.

                    KATHRYN
          Michael, you don't have to go
          down there.

                    MIKE
          I want that shark, Kathryn.

                    KATHRYN
          You don't have to prove anything.

          Don't worry.  I've handled sharks
          before.

     A quick kiss and he goes into the water.  Kathryn
     watches.

     UNDERWATER                                       

     Mike and Bob dive to the

     TUNNEL ENTRANCE                                       

     Mike stops there, and Bob continues to the bottom.

     Welding hook eyes to tunnel mouth.

     REVERSE ANGLE                                       

     Mike is intense and worried as he welds.  ANGLE DOWN,
     the shark's tail is swishing, more agitated.

     BOB                                            

     Glances up toward the shark, concerned about the JACK
     HAMMER NOISE.  He suddenly startled by something
     touching him.

     REVERSE - IT'S MIKE                                  

     He's finished with the welding and motions for them to
     get the net assembly.

     MIKE AND BOB                                       

     Quickly get the hell out of there.

     SURFACE                                            

     Mike breaks through, followed by Bob.  They pull them-
     selves up onto shore.  Clasp hands tightly.  Machismo.

                    MIKE
          Way to go, Bob.  Way to go!

     KATHRYN                                       

     Hurries over to Mike.  She's greatly concerned.

                    KATHRYN
          Are you okay?

                    MIKE
          (smiling)
          I'm  fine.

     They hug.

     PHILIP                                            

     It's his turn now.  He grabs Ike.

                    PHILIP
          Let's go.

     They start into the water.  Mike comes over to Philip.

                    MIKE
          (warning)
          He's big, Hutton.  You never saw
          anything so big.  Watch yourself.

                    PHILIP
          Always do.

     They submerge into the water.

     MIKE                                            

     Grabs walkie-talkie.

     Reacting as the lights go on.  Immediately, Philip
     switches on his head lantern and begins to check the
     camera.  Ike looks uneasily toward the tunnel entrance.

     The net across it, cables raising from each anchor pin.
     The shark cannot be seen inside the tunnel.

     PHILIP AND IKE                                       

     Philip flathands Ike on the shoulder, startling him.
     He points to Ike's lights, and Ike nods jerkily, turns
     them on, turns on his head lantern.  Philip gestures
     for them to get closer to the center of the net.  Ike
     hesitates.  Again, Philip hits him on the shoulder,
     gestures impatiently.

     MIKE

     As the water current slows down in the tunnel.  The
     shark begins to stir.  The principals on shore wait,
     looking toward the lagoon.

     PHILIP AND IKE                                       

     Philip gestures for them to get closer yet to the
     center of the net.  Ike holds back.  Philip gestures
     angrily, and Ike has to go along but is most unhappy
     about it.

     SHOTS                                            

     The water current getting weaker and weaker.  The

     Ike holds back, and Philip grabs his arm, pulling him.
     Ike looks toward the tunnel with mounting dread.

          It's coming out.  Get ready.

     UNDERWATER - PHILIP                                  

     Stays right on top of it as the shark continues to back
     out.  Philip looks over his shoulder and sees Ike
     taking off, terrified.

     PHILIP                                            

     Obsessed, he continues to film, despite incredible
     risk.  The shark slowly, ominously backs up, backs up...

     SHARK                                            

     Is now OUT of the tunnel.  Philip keeps filming.

     SHARK                                            

     Suddenly SWINGS AROUND, its incredible, massive head
     now turned to Philip and CAMERA.  It is JAWS!

     PHILIP                                            

     Stunned, backpedals frantically as the

     Thrashes forward into the NET.

     MIKE                                            

     Swims frantically, the cave seeming so close yet so far.

     SHARK                                            

     Alarmingly close, mouth open for the kill.

     ANGLE ON MIKE                                       

     At mouth of cave, desperately reaching for the lip.

     He swings into the cave... and out of the shark's path
     as

     THE HUGE BEAST                                       

     Immediately surges past, crashing into the cave's
     entrance.

     MIKE                                            

     Reacts to the close call.

     MASSIVE TAIL                                       

     Whips past, colliding with cave overhang, causing the
     overhang to fracture from the heavy blow.

     CLOSE ON MIKE                                       

     His face reflecting concern as light changes and there
     is a

     CAVE-IN                                            

     We see that Mike is blocked by fallen debris.

     KATHRYN - ON SHORE                                  

     Grabs Bob as he is helped from the water.  Shelly
     pulls ashore a traumatized Ike.

     KATHRYN AND BOB                                       

                    KATHRYN
          Where's Michael?  What's happened
          to him?

     Bob shakes his head mutely.

                    BOB
          ... I don't know.  The shark got
          him.

     Kathryn grabs a walkie-talkie.

                    KATHRYN
          Can you see Michael?

     CONTROL ROOM                                       

     Man looking at the monitor screens for the Fun Tunnel
     area.

                    MAN
          We're not sure.

                    KATHRYN (V.O.)
          Look!

     CAMERA moves in fast on the screen to show the cave
     entrance.

     ANGLE ON CAVE ENTRANCE - MIKE                             

     Trying to pull loose some of the fallen concrete to get
     out, looking for the shark.  The concrete pieces are
     too heavy.

     KATHRYN AND BOB                                       

                    KATHRYN
          Well?!

                    OPERATOR (V.O.)
          We think he's trapped inside a
          cave beside the glass tunnel.
          The shark broke up the entrance.

                    KATHRYN
          Where is the shark?

                    OPERATOR (V.O.)
          Near the bay gate.

     Kathryn hesitates, then runs out of FRAME, Bob and
     the others watching her go in surprise.

     SHOTS                                            

     Kathryn running desperately toward her compound.  Mike
     trying, in vain, to get out of the cave.

     SHARK COMPOUND DOCK - KATHRYN                             

     Running to the sub, untying it, jumping in, pulling
     the canopy shut, and turning on the engine.  As the
     SUB moves into the lagoon, she puts on the scuba mask.

     BOBBY AND DAISY                                       

     Seeing her leave, they begin to butt frantically at
     the still-unrepaired gate opening of their pen.

     SUB                                            

     Moving through the lagoon.

     SUB - KATHRYN                                       

     Looking around uneasily as she drives the sub.

     WHAT SHE SEES - THE LAGOON                             

     O.S., we hear the SOUND OF THE SUB.  No sign of the
     shark.

     MIKE                                            

     Trapped in the cave.  He hears the O.S. SOUND of the
     sub and looks out, trying to see.

     THE SUB                                            

     Emerging from the water, coming straight at CAMERA.

     INT. SUB - KATHRYN                                  

     Camera draws around to show the cave ahead.  She looks
     around again for the shark.

     FULL SHOT - THE SUB                                  

     Coming up to the cave.  Kathryn starts to push the sub
     front against the fallen concrete.

     MIKE                                            

     Pushing to one side to avoid the concrete piece the
     sub is pushing in.

     FULL SHOT - THE SUB                                  

     Pushing at the concrete piece.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Inside the sub, concentrating on the cave.  Suddenly, a
     dark form flashes into FRAME just overhead, making her
     jump in shock.  Then she sees --

     BOBBY AND DAISY                                       

     Swimming around the sub.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Returns to the concrete piece.

     FULL SHOT - THE SUB                                  

     Pushing in the concrete piece.

     MIKE                                            

     Pressed against the cave wall, is almost touched by
     the concrete piece.  Now there is room enough for him
     to get out.

     FULL SHOT - MIKE                                  

     Starts to push out through the cave opening.  CAMERA
     ZOOMS IN on his face as he sees --

     THE SHARK                                       

     In the distance, approaching again.

     KATHRYN AND DOLPHINS                                  

     She reacts, seeing the dolphins dart out of FRAME.
     She looks after them.

     POINT OF VIEW SHOT - THE DOLPHINS                        

     Speeding toward the shark to intercept it.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Her face reflecting her fear for the dolphins as she
     opens the canopy for Mike to get in.  He closes the
     canopy, both looking apprehensively toward the shark.

     WHAT THEY SEE - THE SHARK                             

     Being butted by the two dolphins, deflecting its charge.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Kathryn starting to drive the sub away.

     FULL SHOT - SUB                                       

     As it starts away from the Fun Tunnel area.

     INT. SUB - MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     Kathryn looking back toward the shark.

     WHAT SHE SEES - THE DOLPHINS                             

     Still attacking the shark with some diversionary success.

     FULL SHOT - SUB                                       

     Starting to rise as it passes over the Spanish Galleon.

     INT. SUB - MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     In the b.g., the shark suddenly comes toward them at
     high speed, its massive size blotting out everything
     in b.g.

     FULL SHOT                                       

     As the giant shark hits the sub broadside.

     INT. SUB                                       

     Turning over in a complete circle, then righting itself,
     Kathryn trying to keep it moving forward.

     FULL SHOT - THE SHARK                                  

     Attacking the submarine again, flinging it around like
     a cork, the attack by the dolphins only diverting it
     slightly.

     INT. SUB                                       

     The shark seen outside, trying to close its jaws around
     the sub.

     FULL SHOT - THE SHARK                                  

     Grabs the sub from behind and starts to shake it.

     INT. SUB - ANGLE PAST MIKE AND KATHRYN                        

     The shark seen in b.g., its enormous jaws closed around
     the back part of the submarine.  Kathryn reaches for
     something.

     INSERT - CONTROL                                  

     As Kathryn's hand in the violently shaking sub manages
     to increase the revolution of the propellers.

     FULL SHOT - THE PROPELLERS                             

     Spin faster, cutting the shark's maw.  Bleeding, it
     backs off, wheeling away.

     INT. SUB - KATHRYN                                  

     Tries to drive it away, but the propellers will not
     turn now, they are jammed.  The sub starts sinking
     toward the bottom.  They both twist around.

     THEIR POV - THE SHARK                                  

     Moving away.

     INT. SUB - KATHRYN                                  

     Points toward the galleon.  Mike hesitates, then sees
     that they have no other chance and they slide back the
     canopy quickly, push out of the sinking sub, and swim
     toward the galleon.  The dolphins suddenly appear in
     FRAME, and Mike and Kathryn grab their fins, looking
     around to see where the shark is, reacting as they see

     THE SHARK                                       

     Rushing back toward them.

     MIKE, KATHRYN, AND DOLPHINS                             

     The dolphins speed them to the opening of the galleon
     hold where they let go of the fins and kick down fast
     into the hold as the dolphins wheel around to attack
     the shark again.

     INT. HOLD OF GALLEON - UP ANGLE                             

     Mike and Kathryn swimming downward toward CAMERA.
     They kick into the dark hold, CAMERA pulling down from
     them, stopping.  They swim past CAMERA and, in the next
     moment, the berserk shark appears, trying to follow
     them into the hold.  It can't get through, the opening
     too small, but shatters part of the framing.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Ducking away from and pushing aside large, falling
     pieces of lumber.  They look up, reacting as they see

     THEIR POV - THE SHARK                                  

     Lunging down into the opening again, breaking off more
     of the hold framing.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Evading more falling wood, backing away as they look up
     at

     THE SHARK                                       

     Trying once more, getting stuck in the hold opening
     which is now enlarged enough for it to wedge in part
     of its enormous form.

     FULL SHOT - THE SHARK                                  

     Trying to get into the hold all the way, the two
     dolphins butting its side.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Mike looks around, sees something and, grabbing Kathryn's
     arm, pulls her further into the body of the sunken hull,
     CAMERA PANNING      to show them moving toward the hole in
     the ship's side.

     EXT. HULL                                       

     As Mike and Kathryn push out through the opening and
     kick up with extreme caution.

     ANGLE ON DECK EDGE                                  

     As Mike and Kathryn appear, looking warily toward

     THE SHARK                                       

     Still in the opening to the hold, trying to break
     through, the dolphins still butting its sides.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Look at each other, then, abruptly, decide and kick
     upward, CAMERA with them.  As they move toward the
     surface, they look down at

     THE SHARK                                       

     Starting to back out of the opening it has battered
     into the hold entrance.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Kicking upward as fast as they can go.

     SURFACE                                            

     As they break through, looking down.

     WHAT THEY SEE - THE SHARK                             

     Coming up at them.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Not knowing what to do.  They start spasmodically as
     the two dolphins rush up from beneath the water and
     appear nearby.  Without a word, Mike and Kathryn grab
     the dolphins' dorsal fins, and the dolphins start to
     rush them away.

     THE CHASE                                       

     Shots alternating between Mike and Kathryn being pulled
     along by the dolphins and the giant shark pursuing them,
     getting closer and closer.  When it becomes apparent that
     the shark is going to overtake them, the dolphins make a
     sharp turn and elude its heavier, straight-forward impetus.
     Seeing where they are, Mike points downward.  Kathryn hits
     Bobby on the side and he dives abruptly.  Daisy follows.

     UNDERWATER                                       

     The dolphins diving with Mike and Kathryn as they put
     their mouthpieces back in.  We see that they are outside
     the Control Room, the men inside looking out at them in
     shock.  Mike lets go of the fin and swims to the lock,
     gesturing for Kathryn to do the same.  She does and
     both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark
     zooms into FRAME from behind CAMERA, rushing at them.

     INSIDE THE RECESS                                  

     As the huge shark comes at them.  Mike activates the
     outer door of the lock, and they are washed in just as
     the shark smashes its head against the concrete, jaws
     missing their feet by inches.

     INT. LOCK                                       

     The shark still trying to get at them.  Mike shuts the
     outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock.
     As it comes below their heads, they pull out their
     mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief.
     He puts his arms around her, and they lean their fore-
     heads together, breathing hard.  The water is out of
     the lock in seconds;  inside, men activate the inner door.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM                                  

     As Mike and Kathryn are helped in by the technicians.
     One of them looks toward the o.s. window suddenly.

                    MAN
          Oh, my God!

     They whirl and look.

     THE SHARK                                       

     Coming straight at the window as fast as it can.  With
     a deafening CRASH, it hits the window and the glass is
     shattered, a wall of water roaring in.

     FULL SHOT - MIKE AND KATHRYN AND THE MEN                   

     Swept across the Control Room by the giant wave of
     water flung around.  One man is smashed against a wall
     and killed.  Several others make it to the door, getting
     out just before the water slams it shut.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Putting their mouthpieces in again as the Control Room
     fills with water.  They look toward

     THE SHARK                                       

     With one of the technicians in its JAWS and is sub-
     dividing him.

     CONTROL ROOM                                       

     Starts flooding.  A tape bank topples , crushing
     female technician.

     IMPALED SHARK                                       

     Thrashes violently, working its way in.  It's caught
     on a huge section of thick glass piercing its side.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Staring at the shark.  Suddenly, the air in Mike's tank
     runs out and, reacting, he taps Kathryn's arm.  She sees
     his problem, takes a deep breath, and gives him her
     mouthpiece.  They look toward the window at a loud SOUND.

     THEIR POV - THE SHARK                                  

     Still very much alive, throwing its gigantic weight
     forward, getting closer and closer to CAMERA, each
     violent lurch cutting its side open more, blood pouring
     from the jagged rent.

     ANGLE PAST SHARK ON MIKE AND KATHRYN                        

     As it gets closer and closer to them.  They back away,
     are blocked by a console.

     ANGLE PAST MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     Showing the shark closer yet.  Despite the impaling
     blade of glass, despite the internal injuries, the
     shark -- in seconds -- will have them.

     CLOSE ON MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     Sharing the mouthpiece, huddled together, helpless now.
     Then Kathryn's eyes widen, both react.

     THE SHARK                                       

     Shaking its head as it inches forward, jaws open wide.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Drawing back.  Kathryn SCREAMS.

     THE SHARK                                       

     Emerging from its maw is Philip's body.

     PHILIP'S BODY                                       

     We see the GRENADE locked in his fist.

     MIKE                                            

     Quickly grasps a metal strip from the tape bank and
     fashions a crude hook.

     MIKE                                            

     Times his move perfectly and KNOCKS the grenade out of
     Philip's locked fist.  The grenade comes to rest between
     the shark's TEETH.  Kathryn gives Mike some air, then

     MIKE                                            

     Leaps forward and SNATCHES the grenade out of the
     shark's mouth.

     MIKE                                            

     Hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Acts as a decoy and lures the shark's attention as

     MIKE                                            

     PULLS the grenade pin and

     SHOVES GRENADE

     Into the distracted shark's mouth.

     MIKE GRABS KATHRYN                                  

     And they roll behind a Control Room desk and computer
     terminal console.

     FULL SHOT SHARK                                       

     As the shark is BLOWN OUT backward through the window
     opening, torn in half by the explosion, its massive
     remains starting to slide toward the lagoon bottom,
     turning the water crimson.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Grabbing the stunned Kathryn, Mike pulls her to the
     window and out, starting upward through the bloody
     water.

     UNDERWATER - MIKE AND KATHRYN                             

     Sharing the air, they slowly float to the surface,
     buddy-buddy breathing.

     SURFACE                                            

     Mike and Kathryn break through.  Helping each other,
     they make their way over to a camera pylon.

     MIKE AND KATHRYN                                  

     Cling to the pylon and each other.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Suddenly looks alarmed as she remembers:

                    KATHRYN
          Bobby and Daisy.

     Mike looks about, no sign of the dolphins.

     KATHRYN                                            

     Slaps the water hard three times.
     No dolphins.
     She does it again.
     And again.

     KATHRYN                                            

     And now, in total ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, she pounds the
     water like Rocky on the punching bag until she is
     drained, and Kathryn breaks down sobbing as Mike holds
     her, trying to comfort her.

     DOLPHINS                                       

     Come shooting to the surface!   They're banged and
     bruised, but are chirping excitedly and as HAPPY to
     see Kathryn and Mike as they are to see them.

     DOLPHINS                                       

     Slowly swim around the hugging Mike and Kathryn as
     CAMERA PULLS UP to show the Sea Kingdom, in all its
     entirety, safe at last.

     FADE OUT.

     THE END
