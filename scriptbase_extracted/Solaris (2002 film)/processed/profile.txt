Solaris
The mood of Solaris is contemplative, stylized, and mind bending.
The plot centers around space travel, dealing with death, and space and aliens.
It is a drama, sci-fi, and romance movie.
Stylistically, Solaris is futuristic and is surreal.
In approach, it is fantastical and serious.
It takes place, at least partly, on a spacecraft.
Solaris is a remake and based on a book.
Note that it includes brief nudity, mild violent content, and sexual content.
